Q.  How to reconnect a build node?

A.  run ./setup-all. It will update and reconnect all build nodes

Q. What scripts are used on the nodes.

Each branch (currnetly, only `trunk') had the following scripts:

    o clean-up -  Clears out the previous checkout.
    o checkout -  Checks out the latest revision from SVN.
    o build    -  Runs the build.
    o test     -  Runs the test suite.
    o extras   -  Runs any additional tasks.

    o connect  - The script that connects the node to the buildbot
		 server.

On the cgywin box, the scripts are in c:\builder.

Q.  How do I set up a new build node?

A.  First, you need python and twisted on the box. Most dristros have
this in rpms, so you can just use those.

Then, download buildbot 0.6.4 from sourceforge. On redhat/suse
systems, you should run:

	python setup.py bdist_rpm

There will then be an rpm in dist that you can install. This allows us
to keep stuff in the rpm database for easy updates, etc.

On other systems, do

	python setup.py install

Add a file in config/ for the buildbot node, and then add it to
setup-all. On mono.ximian.com, you'll need to modify private.py to add
a new lane.
