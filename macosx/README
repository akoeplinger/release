monobuild.sh is a complete rewrite of the build system for Mono on OS X.  It has stolen some ideas from DarwinPorts to solve some issues.

current invokation is:

monobuild.sh YES YES YES $PWD
where
	first arg is whether configure should be run YES|NO
	second arg is whether make should run YES|NO
	third arg is where make install should run YES|NO
	fourth arg is the directory to the release/macosx directory
		(that's the macos dir inside the release module in svn)

need to clean up command line args and/or add getops so that more things can be specified at the command line.  Currently you need to edit the script, but it works
