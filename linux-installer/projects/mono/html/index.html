<br/>
<p>The Mono Installer provides you with the easiest way to install
and run the Mono platform in a variety of Linux distributions.</p>

<p>Mono is a comprehensive open source development platform
based on the .NET framework that allows developers to build Linux and
cross-platform applications with unprecedented productivity. Mono's
.NET implementation is based on the ECMA standards for C# and the
Common Language Infrastructure.</p>

<p>For further information, please visit the <a 
href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono Project website.</a></p>

<br/><br/>
<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>
<br>
<p>The goal of the Mono Installer is to run in the same platforms that Mono does. This release has been tested on the following x86-based Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Hat 9.0</li>
<li>Fedora Core 1, 2, 3</li>
<li>Suse Enterprise Server 9</li>
<li>Suse Linux 9.0</li>
<li>Novell Linux Desktop 9</li>
</ul>
<p>The binaries have been built on Red Hat 9, so they will not work with older platforms with incompatible GLIBC, such as Suse Enterprise Server 8.0.
If you are using Mandrake 10, you may need to set the following environment variable : <pre>MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/bin</pre></p>
<p>Support for Windows and OSX is planned.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>The same Mono binary installer will work across all Linux Distributions.
The first step is to download the installer file and add executable permissions:
</p>
<p>
<code>chmod +x mono-@@BITROCK_MONO_VERSION@@-linux-installer.bin</code>
</p>
<p>You can now execute it either by double clicking it from your desktop environment or launch it from the command line:</p>
<p>
<code>./mono-@@BITROCK_MONO_VERSION@@-linux-installer.bin</code>
</p>
<p>You could also launch the installer in text or unattended modes:</p>
<p>
<code>./mono-@@BITROCK_MONO_VERSION@@-linux-installer.bin --mode text</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>./mono-@@BITROCK_MONO_VERSION@@-linux-installer.bin --mode unattended</code>
</p>
<p>After this, follow the on-screen instructions. By default, the software will be installed in the ~/mono-@@BITROCK_MONO_VERSION@@ directory. An icon will be created in your desktop environment that will allow you
to invoke the different applications such as Mono Doc, Mono Develop as well as to uninstall.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h1>Components</h1>
<p>The Mono Installer includes the following components.</p>

<p><b>Mono Runtime:</b> Mono includes a compiler for the C# language,
an ECMA-compatible runtime engine (the Common Language Runtime, or
CLR),and class libraries. 
<p><b>ADO.NET</b>: Including support for MySQL, SQLite, IBM DB2, Sybase, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.</p>
<p><b>ASP.NET</b>: Web development. Includes XSP
<p><b>GTK#</b>: GTK# is an event-driven system windowing library. This library allows you to build fully native Gnome application using Mono and includes support for user interfaces built with the Glade interface
builder.</p>
<p><b>Mono Develop</b>: An integrated development environment for creating Mono applications.</p>
<p><b>MonoDoc</b>: A scalable documentation browser and editor developed especially for Mono and .NET</p>
<p><b>IKVM</b>: A Java VM for .NET</p>
<p><b>Windows Forms</b>: Preview release of System.Windows.Forms</p>
<br/><br/>
<h1>About this installer</h1>
<p>Future versions will add a number of improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different editions, with only a subset of the components: for ASP.NET development, for GUI development, etc.</li>
<li>Allow package selection during the installation process.</li>
<li>On demand download from the Internet.</li>
<li>Interface with distribution-specific package management systems, such as RPM and Debian.</li>
</ul>
