General procedure for building jails:
-----------------------------------------------

one way to do it is install a distro and then tar up the root drive, and then extract the tarball an another machine

I thought it was kind of a pain and usually a distro install installs many more packages than you actually need in the jail.

So, use gatherrpms.py to collect all the rpms for a certain distro.

Then, fill out a jail config file (sample_jail_config.txt),

run: (as root or under sudo)

./buildjail.py <config_file> <destination jail dir>

It may take some figuring out to create the jail just right, but once you have it, it's much easier to recreate the jail for future use.

I recommend documenting the sites you got the rpms from in the jail config.

Note, this procedure also works for producing rpm based jails on debian based distros

Noticed quirks
--------------
redhat-9-i386: rpm commands will only work with the following environment var:
	LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
	make sure in the jail config file you specify:
		environment=LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
	This environment var is needed if you're running on a machine that's not 		running the rh9 stock kernel
