<h1>mscorlib Assembly Mono 1.0 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>msorlib missing functionality</h2>

	Read the mscorlib-status.xsl spreadsheet prepared by Lluis.

<h2>COM</h2>

	<p>Mono 1.0 does not support COM integration of any kind.
	This is due to the fact that COM is not a standard part of the
	operating system on Unix.

	<p>There are various custom implementations of COM available:
	XPCOM (Mozilla) and UNO (OpenOffice) which we might support in
	the future through some dynamic extension to the runtime. 

	<p>The following API calls do nothing, or are not supported:
	
<h2>Code Access Security</h2>

	<p>Mono 1.0 does not ship with a Code Access Security layer,
	which means that it can not be used as a host to run code in a
	sandbox.  We intend to ship this in an upcoming version.

	<p>The following API calls do nothing, or are not supported:
	
<h2>Security features</h2>
	
	<p><b>Namespace:</b> System.Security.Principal

	<p><span id="method">WindowsIdentity</span>
	
        <p>Fx 1.1 add special support for a Windows 2003 Server "client"
        in a Windows 2003 Server based domain. I don't have the
        environment to test this. I doubt this is really being much used
        (since most clients aren't W2K3 based).
        
        <p>Recommendation: Keep TODO for a future version of Mono. Throw a
        ArgumentException on Windows (like it's done for Windows
        versions previous to W2K3 Server). Add a special note in
        monodoc.
