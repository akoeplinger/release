        - Fx 1.1 add special support for a Windows 2003 Server "client"
        in a Windows 2003 Server based domain. I don't have the
        environment to test this. I doubt this is really being much used
        (since most clients aren't W2K3 based).
        
        Recommendation: Keep TODO for a future version of Mono. Throw a
        ArgumentException on Windows (like it's done for Windows
        versions previous to W2K3 Server). Add a special note in
        monodoc.
