Several scripts use methods in packaging.py to select the latest version of a package.

This method will look for an environment variable of the name of a file in version_selection_conf.

The version_selection_conf file will contain mappings to certain versions for certain 'selection_conf's.

This gives many possibilities:

-We can build packages targeted for a previous release
-We can build different versions of installers based on an environment variable
-We can publish and generate webpages for different releases, and previously releases can
 be easily updated
-We can generate different package repositories based on a version_selection.

version_selections will generally follow maintained branches.


TODO:
Document all the options that are available in a bundle config:

version selections:
-If the version map isn't there, latest package will be used
-If version map is there, only those packages will be used
-If a version without a release is specified, that version using the latest
 release will be used.
-If a version with a release is used, that exact release will be used and
 scripts will fail if it's not there.  Specify release of 0 to get a version
 without a release
-If the version is "", the latest version for that package will be used


HEAD_or_RELEASE can be specified in bundle config.  This defaults to RELEASE
if not specified.  This would only be useful if we wanted to build an
installer from trunk.
