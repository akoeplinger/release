Several scripts use methods in packaging.py to select the latest version of a package.

This method will look for an environment variable of the name of a file in version_selection_conf.

The version_selection_conf file will contain mappings to certain versions for certain 'selection_conf's.

This gives many possibilities:

-We can build packages targeted for a previous release
-We can build different versions of installers based on an environment variable
-We can publish and generate webpages for different releases, and previously releases can
 be easily updated
-We can generate different package repositories based on a version_selection.

version_selections will generally follow maintained branches.
