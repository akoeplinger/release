# Note, the above tags are a little weird... here's now the automation handles them:
# Example tag: svn+ssh://mono-cvs.ximian.com/source/tags/gtk-sharp/2.3.92_2.5.92/gtk-sharp
# example mktarball:  ./mktarball suse-93-i586 gtk-sharp-2.0 2.3.92
# example mktarball:  ./mktarball suse-93-i586 gtk-sharp-2.6 2.5.92
# Another note: 2.7.1 and above require the tarball to be built on suse-100-i586
#   ex:  ./mktarball suse-100-i586 gtk-sharp-2.8 2.7.90

#  I believe it's the same with ./build
