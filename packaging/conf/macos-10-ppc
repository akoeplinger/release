# NOTE: we can build on 10.4 with the 10.3 sdk as long we don't use @executable_path
#  (We may just end up using @executable_path just for the installer)
# set CC to make sure we build with the 10.3 sdk
# These extra defines are needed when building on 10.4 with 10.3 sdk (not needed when building on 10.3)
# headerpad_max_install_names helps with relocating binaries to a destination of a very large pathname
