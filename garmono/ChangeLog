	* gar.mk: Fixed PATH environment var using "$(bindir):$(sbindir):$(PATH)",
	it makes more sense for our build environment. Also fixed LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	and included PKG_CONFIG_PATH, C_INCLUDE_PATH and ACLOCAL_PATH.

	* gar.conf.mk: Include ~/.gar.conf file if exists, so is possible to have
	some local configuration to override default settings. Also remove all
	unneeded stuff from file.

	* gar.category.mk: Removed, we will use tasks instead of categories.

	* mono/xsp: XSP package added.

	* mono/mod_mono: mod_mono package added.

	* gar.bugs.mk: Deleted.

	* gar.mk:
	- INSTALL_DIRS vars removed, we wont create all dir for every instalation
	we will create it as part of install scripts.
	- Commented the inclusion of gar.bugs.mk, it looks to be useless for non
	debian systems.

	* meta/build: Default meta package to build mono to DESTDIR, normally
	/opt/mono.
