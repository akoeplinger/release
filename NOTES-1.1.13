This is the 1.1.13 branch, which is the branch that we are shipping in SUSE
line of enterprise products, and hence is a long lived product until we 
ship Mono 1.2 in a service pack.

There are some parts of Mono that remain under development and those must be
copied on each micro release of 1.1.13 from trunk, these are:

	mcs/ilasm
	mcs/class/PEAPI
	libgdiplus
	mcs/class/System.Drawing
	mcs/class/System.Windows.Forms
