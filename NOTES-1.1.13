This is the 1.1.13 branch, which is the branch that we are shipping in SUSE
line of enterprise products, and hence is a long lived product until we 
ship Mono 1.2 in a service pack.

There are some parts of Mono that remain under development and those must be
copied on each micro release of 1.1.13 from trunk, these are:

	mcs/ilasm
	mcs/class/PEAPI
	libgdiplus
	mcs/class/System.Drawing
	mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms

mcs portion done with (from mcs branch dir):

svn rm ilasm class/PEAPI class/System.Drawing class/Managed.Windows.Forms

Commit.... then

svn cp $MSVN/trunk/mcs/ilasm 				.
svn cp $MSVN/trunk/mcs/class/PEAPI 			class
svn cp $MSVN/trunk/mcs/class/System.Drawing 		class
svn cp $MSVN/trunk/mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms 	class


# Also, if there are changes to libgdiplus, this will need to go from trunk 
to the 1.1.13 branch
