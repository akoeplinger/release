	<p>All of the changes since 1.2 are documented in the
	following release notes:

	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.1">1.2.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.2">1.2.2</a>,

<h2>Major Highlights</h2>

	<p>This is the last release before the 2.0 release of Mono, it
	is a stable release and at this point the generics and the VM
	are supported feature complete.
	
	<p>This version fixes a bug in reflection that affects
	existing Gtk# deployments;   To install this release you
	should install the new version of Gtk# (released at the same
	time as Mono).

	<p>C# compiler now defaults to the C# 3.0 mode.

	<p>Silverlight support is now enabled by default.
	
<a name="changes">
<h2>Runtime Engine</h2>

	<p>Optimization: Generics code sharing [Mark].

	<p>AOT support for ARM processors [Zoltan].

	<p><a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&long_desc_type=fulltext&long_desc=&classification=Mono&product=Mono%3A+Runtime&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEEDINFO&bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&chfieldfrom=2007-11-09&chfieldto=2008-01-28&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=">Runtime
	bugs fixed/closed in this release</a>

	<p>Continued the work on the Mono verifier and making the
	runtime more robust when coping with broken assemblies.

<h2>LINQ</h2>

	<p>Core LINQ (Linq to Objects) library support has been
	updated to the .NET 3.5 API [JB, MarekS]
	
	<p>System.Xml.Linq is now part of the standard distribution
	[Atsushi] 

<h2>Tools</h2>

<h3>Gui-Compare</h3>
	<p>A new tool <tt>gui-compare</tt> can be used to compare API
	changes between different assemblies or descriptions of
	APIs. You can use this to track API changes in your libraries
	to ensure no regressions have occurred accidentally.

	<p>gui-compare comes with various presets that allow
	developers to explore the APIs that Mono ship against the
	Microsoft published APIs and profiles

<h3>Gendarme</h3>
	<p>For the first time <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a> 
	is available inside a Mono release. Gendarme is a tool to find 
	problems in software. Gendarme inspects programs and libraries 
	that contain code in ECMA CIL format (Mono and .NET) and looks 
	for common problems with the code, problems that compiler do not 
	typically check or have not historically checked.

	<p>Contributors: Sebastien Pouliot, Aaron Tomb, Russell Morris, 
	Christian Birkl, N&eacute;stor Salceda, Nidhi Rawal, Lukasz Knop,
	JB Evain, Daniel Abramov, Andreas Noever, Adrian Tsai

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>C# 3.0 is now the default mode of operation for the C#
	compiler.   It is no longer necessary to specify the
	-langversion:linq command line option.

	<p>Due to this new default, the System.Core.dll assembly is
	now referenced and this might cause some type ambiguities, in
	particular with the "Action" type (System.Action from
	System.Core vs Gtk.Action for example).    The fix is to
	either use fully qualified names for Gtk.Action, or to use
	namespace aliases. 

	<p>There are a couple of known limitations: very complicated
	LINQ statements still fail to compile, and Expression trees
	are not completely supported in this release.

	<p>The mcs/gmcs parsers have also been unified, which will
	help reduce the maintenance burden on the compiler.
	
<h2>ASP.NET</h2>

	<p>New mapping feature. This feature makes it easier to make your cross-platform 
           applications work on many platforms without changing the configuration settings.
           More information can be found on <a href="http://mono-project.com/ASP.NET_Settings_Mapping">this page</a>. [Marek]
	<p>Batch compilation of sites. Unlike previously, the 2.0 applications
           are now by default compiled in the batch mode. That means, the first
           time a request is made to a location, files from the location are compiled
           together into one assembly (separate assemblies are used for .aspx and .as[hmc]x
           files). It makes the requests to other files at the same location much faster
           and reduces clutter in the temporary directory. [Marek]
        <p>The XSP test suite has been given a facelift. Both 1.1 and 2.0 sets of tests now
           share the design and navigation. Many samples were fixed or completed. [Marek]
        <p>Speed optimization in the System.Web assembly [Mainsoft, Marek]

<h2>Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>The OSX native backend has been vastly improved and is now
	the default for Windows.Forms applications on OSX.   The X11
	driver is still available, to use it you must set the
	MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11 environment variable [Geoff].

	<p>More support for WebBrowser events/DOM [Andreia].

	<p>Many fixes for RichTextBox, AutoScaling, and PropertyGrid 
	[Luke Page, James Purcell, Ivan, respectively].

	<p>Over 100 reported bugs fixed for this release.
	[Winforms team and contributors].

<h2>Class Libraries</h2>

	<p>Many fixes to support the Dynamic Language Runtime are
	available as part of this release.   It is now possible to
	build and use the DLR with Mono.

	<p>System.Core: A HashSet implementation is now available on
	System.Core and we have  updated the TimeZoneInfo class.
	
<h2>Mono.Posix Improvements</h2>

	<p><a href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.aspx?tlink=0@ecma%3a149%23Stdlib%2fM%2f53"
	>Stdlib.signal()</a> has been deprecated, as its use was inherently usafe.
	<tt>Stdlib.signal()</tt>'s functionality has been replaced with a pair of
	members: [Jonathan Pryor]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<tt>Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.SetSignalAction (Mono.Unix.Native.Signum, Mono.Unix.Native.SignalAction)</tt> 
			permits specifying whether to perform the default action
			(<tt>SignalAction.Default</tt>), ignore the signal
			(<tt>SignalAction.Ignore</tt>), or generate an error 
			(<tt>SignalAction.Error</tt>) when the specified signal is generated.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <tt>Mono.Unix.UnixSignal</tt> class permits instances to represents 
			the signal itself, supporting polling to see if the signal has been 
			generated via the <tt>UnixSignal.IsSet</tt> instance property, or 
			blocking the current thread until the signal has been generated with
			<tt>UnixSignal.WaitOne()</tt>.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h2><tt>mono-service</tt></h2>

	<p>The <tt>mono-service</tt> and <tt>mono-service2</tt> programs no longer
	poll every 500ms to pause, continue, or stop a service.  They will instead
	sleep until the signal is generated. [Jonathan Pryor]</p>

<h2>Visual Basic Runtime</h2>

	<p>More support in the IO classes for Visual Basic [Rolf]

<h2>mod_mono, xsp</h2>

	<p>New support for controlling the number of requests that are
	passed to the mod-mono-server process.   If you have not
	changed the number of threads in the Mono thread pool, this
	can help you prevent deadlocks caused to the Mono ThreadPool
	getting exhausted by incoming HTTP connections ([Joshua]).

	<p>This is controlled with two new Apache directives:
	"MonoMaxActiveRequests" and "MonoMaxWaitingRequests". 

<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>SSL/TLS now support X.509 server certificate using 
	wildcards (e.g. *.novell.com) [Sebastien]
