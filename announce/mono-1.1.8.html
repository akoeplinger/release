<h1>Mono 1.1.8 Development Release</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.1.8 is the eighth release on the development series
	of Mono. The Mono 1.1.x series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

	<p>We consider Mono 1.1.8 stable enough to recommend it for all users.
	Those upgrading from the 1.0.x series should note that these notes
	only contain the differences between 1.1.7 and 1.1.8.   All of the
	changes since 1.0 are documented in the following release notes:
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3">1.1.3</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4">1.1.4</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.5">1.1.5</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.6">1.1.6</a> and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.7">1.1.7</a>.

<h3>Building with Visual Studio</h3>

	<p>Visual Studio solution to build Mono runtime natively on
	Windows.   This is useful if you are embedding the Mono
	runtime into your application and want to debug and single
	step inside Mono.

<h3>Debugger</h3>

	<p>The Mono Debugger is being released in sync for the first
	time with the Mono runtime.  We need testers to try it out
	(the command line debugger is called `mdb').

	
<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>Here a toplevel list of all things new for 1.1.8 MWF:

	<ul>
		<li>DomainUpDown and NumericUpDown implemented
		<li>First version with DataGrid support (still incomplete)
		<li>First version with MDI support (still incomplete)
		<li>Drag & Drop implemented for X11 and Win32
		<li>Clipboard implemented for X11 and Win32
		<li>HelpProvider implemented
		<li>ErrorProvider implemented
		<li>Cursor class completed
		<li>ResXWriter and ResXReader completed
		<li>SWF.Timers now working properly
		<li>A bunch of compatibility fixes
		<li>Image I/O now working on Win32 (this is actually
		in System.Drawing)
	</ul>


<h3>Scaling, Performance</h3>

	<p>Harinath has been fine tuning our Regular Expressions class
	library to reduce allocations which translate into an increase
	in performance (about 10% on the output match).
	Regexp.Replace will now be O(number of $s in the replacement
	string) instead of O(length of replacement string).  The

	<p>The 1024 limit on Socket.Select is gone, Mono will now use
	poll when available.

	<p>System.Web will consume less memory as well (Gonzalo). 

<h3>Code Access Security</h3>

	<p>Sebastien's progress in this release:

	<ul>
	<li>AppDomain based sandboxes are supported (limited by
	#74411);
	
	<li>Stack propagation for async code, threads and SWF;
	
	<li>Default policies (like LocalIntranet, Internet...) are now supported;

	</ul>

	<p>The new features allows NRobot 0.20
	(http://home.gna.org/nrobot/) to "work" (as much as the
	permissions are currently present in the class libraries) on
	Mono 1.1.8 with a single modification (change the imperative
	assert in NRobot/Engine/GameArena.cs to a declarative assert).

<h3>ASP.NET 2.x controls</h3>

	<p>Lluis completed various new controls for ASP.NET 2.x:
	ImageMap, Wizard, SiteMapDataSource and SiteMapPath.

<h3>Reflection</h3>

	<p>Lluis added support for producing debugging information
	from Reflection.Emit.   This means that all the
	Reflection-based compilers and VMs will be able to produce
	debugging information and have the Mono debugger step through
	the code. 
	
<h3>Packaging</h3>

	<P> mono-ikvm has been merged into mono-core. Should make it easier
        for people to get ikvm

	<p> mono-nunit is back with the nunit stuff. Needed for mono-tools
	
<h3>Mono-shlib-cop</h3>

	<p>Jonathan Pryor has contributed this tool to assist
	developers that use P/Invoke.

	<p>mono-shlib-cop is a tool that inspects a managed assembly
	looking for erroneous or suspecious behavior of shared libraries.

	<p>The tool takes one or more assembly filenames, and inspects each
	assembly specified.

	<p>The errors checked for include:
	<ul>
	<li>Does the shared library exist?
	<li>Does the requested symbol exist within the shared library?
	<p>It also checks if a program uses shared libraries that are
	part of a -devel package.
	</ul>

<h3>VB.NET</h3>

	<p>New on this release: late binding, decimal, named
	arguments, optiona byrefs, 

<h3>Mono.Unix</h3>

	<p>The Mono.Unix namespace will be replacing the old
	Mono.Posix in Mono 1.2 and is still under development.  In
	this release cleanups continued and a few new features are
	present.

	<p>Changes since the last release:
	<ul<
		<li>Removed types: MapAttribute, IncludeAttribute, 
		ErrorMarshal, ErrorMarshal.ErrorTranslator
		<li>Removed UnixMarshal.IsErrorDescriptionThreadSafe property
		<li>Renamed LockFlags enum to LockfCommand
		<li>Removed StdioFileStream.FilePosition property and replaced with
		RestoreFilePosition() and SaveFilePosition() methods
		<li>Renamed UnixConvert.ToFilePermissions(string) to 
		UnixConvert.FromOctalPermissionString(string)
	</ul>
	
      <p>Additions
      <ul>
      
      		<li>Syscall.execv(), Syscall.execve(),
		Syscall.execvp(), Syscall.fexecve()

		<li>Syscall.fcntl (int, FcntlCommand, DirectoryNotifyFlags)
		
		<li>Syscall.mmap, Syscall.munmap, Syscall.msync, Syscall.mlock,
		  Syscall.munlock, Syscall.mlockall, Syscall.munlockall,
		  Syscall.mremap, Syscall.mincore,  Syscall.remap_file_pages
		
		<li>Syscall.mkstemp
		
		<li>Thread safety for "obvious" exports from Stdlib, Syscall
		
		<li>UnixConvert.ToOctalPermissionString, 
		  UnixConvert.FromUnixPermissionString,
		  UnixConvert.ToUnixPermissionString
		
		<li>UnixFileInfo uses stat(2) now, not lstat(2), so a UnixFileInfo
		  created on a symlink will give information about the target, 
		  not the link.
		
      </ul>
      <p>Lots of documentation added

<h3>JScript</h3>

	<p>Cesar implemented access to local variables in nested
	functions in JScript.
	
<h3>Bug fixes, scalability</h3>

	<p>There are plenty of bug fixes, performance and scalability
	improvements that are too detailed to list on the release
	notes.

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.8</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.8 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<p>Fedora Core 4 users: packages will work out of the box, but
	the source code will be misscompiled by gcc4.

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.8

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE, SLES, Fedora Core, RHEL are
	available from our web site from the
        <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">download</a>
        section.

	<p>MacOS and Windows packages will be uploaded soon.
	</blockquote>
        
	<p><b>Source code:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<ul>
	  <li>Mono Source Code: <a href="http://go-mono.com/sources/mono-1.1/mono-1.1.8.tar.gz">mono-1.1.8.tar.gz</a>
	</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>
        
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	 source code is very simple.
	
	 <p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-1.1.8.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-1.1.8
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
	
</pre>
	</blockquote>
