<h1>What is new in Mono 1.2</h1>

	<p>A general overview of the Mono project is available in the
	<a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/meeting06/OpeningPresentation.pdf">opening
	presentation</a> for the 2006 Mono Meeting.   A number of
	presentations on various Mono-related technologies are
	available also from <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/meeting/schedule.aspx">this
	page</a> 
	
<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>The Windows.Forms 1.1 API is now available, it includes all
	of the controls in the standard specification, a complete
	System.Drawing implementation.

	<p>The Windows.Forms implementation has a WndProc compatible
	design, so most third party widgets that use WndProc to
	achieve special effects will work out of the box. 
	
	<p>Currently there are drivers for X11 and Win32 and will run
	on Windows systems or systems with the X11 windowing system
	(Linux, Unix and OSX when using the X11 package).

<h3>System.Drawing</h3>

	<p>System.Drawing is now complete, and in addition to
	being the underlying rendering engine for Windows.Forms, it
	has also been tested for using third party controls that
	heavily depend on it.

<h3>System.ServiceProcess</h3>

	<p>An implementation of ServiceProcess is now available, see
	the mono-service man page for details.

<h3>System.Transactions</h3>

        <p>We now have a basic implementation of System.Transactions.
        The implementation uses a Lightweight Transaction Manager
        (LTM) allowing multiple volatile and/or a single durable
        resource manager.

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>Mono 1.2 ships with complete C# 1.0 and C# 2.0 compilers,
	called <tt>mcs</tt> and <tt>gmcs</tt> respectively.

	<p>The C# compilers are built on C# themselves and they are
	faster than in previous versions.   They are able to compile
	26k lines of C# code per second.

	<p>In addition to complete the 2.0 language coverage, much
	effort has been placed on providing good error reports and
	warnings.
	
	<p>For more details about the compiler see our <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/CSharp_Compiler">C# Compiler
	Page</a>

<h3>Mono Ports</h3>

	<p>The Mono 1.2 code generator has been ported to a variety of
	new platforms, both 32-bit and 64 bit ports are supported and
	today they include the following architectures and operating
	systems:

	<p>32 bit systems: x86, PowerPC, ARM, s390, SPARC.

	<p>64 bit systems: x86-64, s390x, Itanium (IA64).

	<p>In addition, our operating system support has expanded and
	many improvements are included for OSX, Windows and BSD.
	
	<p>In addition preview ports for Alpha and MIPS are also
	available. 
	
	<p>For more information see our detailed list of <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Supported_Platforms">supported
	platforms</a>.

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

	<p>These are some of the highlights of the optimizations done
	between Mono 1.0 and Mono 1.2, but they are only a subset.
	
	<p><b>Default Optimizations:</b> inlining, dead code
	elimination, constant folding and constant propagation are now
	added to the default set of optimizations and have a
	noticeable impact on performance (anywhere from 6% to 30%
	depending on the architecture and particular tests).
	
	<p><b>Ahead of Time Compilation: </b> The Mono runtime now
	supports ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, startup performance
	is actually reduced and the code is actually shared across
	multiple Mono instances reducing the overall memory
	consumption of applications.  AOT is not enabled by default on
	the installation of Mono 1.2 assemblies, but can be done by
	end users by running:

	<pre>
	mono --aot assembly.dll
	</pre>

	<p>For all the system assemblies, or assemblies in the GAC.

	<p><b>Arrays Bounds Check Elimination:</b> If the JIT can
	infer that access to an array (for example in a loop) will not
	be out of range, the JIT will not emit the array range check
	operations (must use <tt>abcrem</tt> optimization).

	<p><b>Partial Redundancy Elimination:</b> An SSA-based partial
	redundancy elimination has been added, and implements various
	partial redundancy optimizations (code hoisting,
	subexpression elimination and more). 

	<p><b>Runtime:</b> The runtime is now statically linked, and
	uses the __thread attribute for thread local storage, which
	provided a performance boost.

	<p><b>Garbage Collector:</b> We now use Boehm GC in precise
	mode as opposed to fully conservative mode.  We also use it
	with a precise set of GC roots which greatly improved Garbage
	Collection performance.

	<p><b>Remoting:</b> performance for the cross application
        domain channel.  Calls across application domains are now
        faster (up to 10 times in some cases).   TCP and HTTP
        transports are now a few order of magnitude faster than in 1.0.

	<p><b>Crytpography:</b> Many improvements were made in
        cryptographic performance, including 8% for SHA1, 5% for
        SHA256 and 20% for TripleDES and MACTripleDES. As well, weak
        key detection for DES is 16 times faster.

        <p>New padding modes ANSI X9.23 and ISO 10126 were implemented
        (for 2.0) for symmetric ciphers and MACTripleDES;

	<p><b>System.Threading.Interlocked:</b> these are now
	JIT-compiled instead of being calls

	<p><b>VM Diet:</b> the VM has gone through a diet, and many
	data structures are smaller, and most data is now shared
	across multiple Mono instances;  Data structures are now only
	loaded on demand, reducing startup time, debug information is
	now loaded using mmap.

	<p>New work to improve Mono's performance is detailed in <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/meeting06/MonoSummit2006-JIT.pdf">Mono
	Summit JIT presentation</a>.
	
<h3>Internationalization</h3>


        <p>We have a completely new reimplementation of the CompareInfo
        infrastructure in this release of Mono, a managed
        implementation of string collation that is compatible with
        Windows collation.

	<p>A new framework for RegionInfo information.

	<p>Support for Cultures, date time formats has been greatly
	expanded as well.

<h3>IO Layer</h3>

	<p>Mono no longer uses a separate daemon for coordinating IO
	operations

	<p>The new portability laye address those problems without
	requiring changes to your code.  This will remove a large
	component of the porting cycle as a whole class of obnoxious
	problems are gone.

	<p>The new portability framework is enabled by setting the
	environment variable <tt>MONO_IOMAP</tt> (which
	we will likely rename to something shorter) to one of the
	following values:

	<ul>
	<li><tt>case</tt>: makes all file system access case
	insensitive.
	
	<li><tt>drive</tt>: strips drive name from pathnames.
	
	<li><tt>all</tt>: enables both <tt>case</tt> and
	<tt>drive</tt>.
	</ul>

	<p>In addition, if any of those options are enabled, the
	directory separator mapping is also turned on.  So this
	basically means that you have to type this, or include this in
	your script that launches your application:

	<pre>
	$ export MONO_IOMAP=all
	$ mono myapp.exe</pre>

	<p>For ASP.NET applications hosted with mod_mono, you can add
	the following directive to your Apache configuration file:

	<pre>
	MonoSetEnv MONO_IOMAP=all</pre>

	
<h3>Profilers</h3>

	<p>Mono 1.2 now contains contains a statistical profiler, as
	well as a profiling interface.

	<p>Developers can create their own profilers and tools to
	instrument code at runtime and capture interesting code
	generation and memory related events.

	<p>A few of the existing profilers include: a code coverage
	profiling module, heap-buddy and heap-shot.

	<p>For more information about profiling see the <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Performance_Tips">performance
	tips</a> page.

<h3>2.0 API support</h2>

	<p>The ECMA 1.0 and 2.0 API profiles have been implemented.
	To build applications that target the 1.0 API use the
	<tt>mcs</tt> compiler;   To target the 2.0 API use the
	<tt>gmcs</tt> compiler.

	<p>ADO.NET, ASP.NET, System.Configuration, and Windows.Forms
	only contain partial support for 2.0 APIs, full support will
	only be available in Mono 2.0.

	<p>In addition memory usage has gone down all across the
	board, in particular in core class libraries like System.XML.

<h3>Mono.Posix improvements</h3>

	<p>Jonathan Pryor lead the development of a new namespace
        which rationalizes the old Mono.Posix namespace, and also adds
        integration classes between the Posix world and the .NET world
        (the old libraries merely exposed the syscall interface).

        <p>The new namespace is called Mono.Unix namespace, and it
        contains the new Syscall class which exports 64-bit APIs.
        This should now be portable across 32-bit and 64-bit
        platforms.

        <p>Added higher-level wrapper classes, all prefixed with Unix, to
        present a .NET-like API over the Syscall functionality.

        <p>The Mono.Unix namespace is also CLS compliant.  The
        low-level Syscall and Stdlib and related types will move into
        the Mono.Unix.Native namespace.  The UnixConvert,
        UnixDirectory, UnixFile, UnixGroup, and UnixUser classes are
        obsolete and will be removed in a future release.  The types
        of existing members will change in the next release.


        <p>The existing Mono.Posix namespace should be considered
        deprecated (or at least unmaintained), in preference to the
        Mono.Unix namespace.

<h3>New assemblies</h3>

	<p>We now ship with bindings for the Cairo API.

	<p>Firebird provider is now bundled with Mono.

	<p>Npgsql is now bundled with Mono.

<h3>Visual Basic, JavaScript and Java</h3>

	<p>Runtimes for both Visual Basic .NET 1.0 and 2.0 are
	now included.

	<p>A runtime for JScript is included.

	<p>IKVM is now bundled with the Mono distribution, and allows
	Java applications to be executed with Mono and the IKVM
	Java Virtual Machine.

<h3>Bundles</h3>

        <p>Bundles are a mechanism to bundle in a single binary the
        Mono runtime, its dependencies and your application to produce
        a standalone application.

        <p>We have now introduced the `mkbundle' program that will
        assist developers in creating self-contained applications
        built with Mono, and it can optionally compress all the
        assemblies bundled, as well as creating static binaries. 
	
<h3>Compatibility</h3>

	<p>Compatibility has been greatly improved in all areas, and
	test suites for the compilers and class libraries have been
	integrated.

	<p>System.Reflection.Emit API now is able to emit debugging
	information in mdb format.

	<p>Support for the registry is now provided on Linux and
	Windows.

	<p>An EventLog implementation is available on both Unix and
        Windows, to use set the MONO_EVENTLOG_TYPE variable like this:

	<p>Mono now supports the #- heap (incremental builds).
	
<h3>File System Watching</h3>

	<p>Support for inotify on Linux and KQueue on BSD is now
	included to monitor file system changes through the
	FileSystemWatcher interface.

<h3>XML</h3>

	<p>Commons.Xml.Relaxng is now part of the standard
	distribution, and has been greatly expanded, it now also
	contains an NVDL implementation and contains a compact syntax
	writer and a grammar inference engine.

<h3>System.Data and Data Providers</h3>

	<p>Sqlite provide now supports Sqlite 2 and 3 installations
	(runtime detection).

<h3>Updated Libraries</h3>

	<p>Updated to newer Novell.LDAP libraries and improved
	System.DirectoryServices

	<p>Include the new ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.

<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<p>A major rewrite to ASP.NET is now available as part of this
        release, the highlights of the new code include:

        <ul>
                <li>Tests: 121,600 lines of new tests:
                <ul>
                        <li>NUnit test suite for about 50% of the controls.

                        <li>Extensive standalone tests.

                        <li>JSUnit (see section later).
                </ul>

                <li>Unmanaged I/O: the new implementation uses
                unmanaged buffers for uploads (HTTP POST for example)
                and content generation as opposed to the managed
                buffers that we have today, which greatly reduces the
                pressure on Mono's GC and also avoids redundant copies
                of data by sharing buffers as much as possible
                improving performance.

                <li> Use of TCP Cork on Linux to avoid TCP glitches
                and delays, this reduces the latency to get a full
                page.

                <li>Support for Linux sendfile to transfer static
                pages (support for more platforms will come later).

                <li>XSP now transfers Socket ownership to the
                AppDomain to avoid round trips and expensive AppDomain
                boundary crossing increasing performance.

                <li>New controls: about 40% of the existing controls
                were rewritten from scratch with test suites to
                validate their output.

                <li>New application pipeline: a new iterators-based
                design reduces the complexity and increases the
                maintainability of the old version.

		<li>Improved tracing support.

                <li>Latency has been reduced in various key places and
                the new unmanaged buffers accelerate the processing of
                medium and large sized pages (small pages remain about
                the same speed) and large uploads wont disrupt your
                Mono process.

		<li>Completed ViewState MAC, a cryptographic checksum to
		prevent tampering with the view state.

	</ul>

<h3>XSP and Mod_mono</h3>

	<ul>

	        <li>XSP has been split up in two: Mono.WebServer.dll and
		xsp.exe.  XSP only handles command line parsing and
		Mono.WebServer.dll is the assembly that implements the
		functionality.

		<p>Mono.WebServer.dll is an embeddable library that can be
		used to host ASP.NET in your own applications.  In the past
		people resorted to making a replica of XSP in their
		applications if they wanted to host ASP.NET.

		<li>XSP now supports --https command line option for
		doing SSL/TLS operations.
		
		<li>mod_mono now supports auto-hosting of web sites,
		greatly reducing configuration of ASP.NET with
		Apache.   See <a
		href="http://www.mono-project.com/AutoConfiguration">our
		auto-configuration</a> page for more details.

		<li>mod_mono now correctly works with virtual hosts.
		
                <li>HttpClientCertificate on XSP and Apache.

		<li>XSP now supports PKCS#12 private
		key/certificates. 
	</ul>
	
<h3>Tools</h3>

	<p>Many new tools are part of Mono 1.2:

	<ul>
		<li><b>AL (assembly linker):</b> can now sign, and delay-sign, assemblies
		and makecert can now generate PKCS#12 files (Sebastien);

		<li><b>prj2make</b>, a tool developed  by Francisco
		Martinez is  now part of the standard  Mono distribution.  You
		can use prj2make  to produce Makefiles that will  work on Unix
		for projects that use Visual Studio solutions.

		<li><b>dtd2xsd:</b> A new tool to produce Xml Schema
		Definitions from an XML document that contains a Document Type
		Definition (DTD), by Atsushi.

		<li><b>mono-xmltool:</b> a tool to validate XML files
		with RelaxNG, XSDs, DTDs, RNCs or NVDLs as well as
		providing a command line tool for doing XSLT
		transforms using the command line.

		<li><b>mono-service:</b> A new tool used to start
		services that implement the System.ServiceProcess
		API.

		<li><b>mozroots:</b> A tool used to import the Mozilla
		TLS and SSL certificates into the Mono trusted
		certificate store (used for HTTPS connections for
		instance).

		<br>Mono by default does not have any root certificates on its
	        certificate store and it is up to each deployment to add the
	        certificates that they trust to the store.  This has caused
	        some confusion with people using TLS and SSL with Mono.  The
	        MozRoots tool makes it simple to import a set of root
	        certificates from Mozilla into the Mono store.

		<li><b>certmgr:</b> can now download and import certificates into the stores (e.g.
		SSL, LDAPS), list existing certificate and remove them from a store.

		<li><b>permview:</b> can display assembly-level
		declarative security present in assemblies (RequestMinimum,
		RequestOptional and RequestRefuse).

		<li><b>mono-shlib-cop:</b> used to inspects a managed
		assembly looking for erroneous or suspecious behavior of
		shared libraries.

		<li><b>ilasm/monodis:</b> the assembler and
		disassembler now are able to roundtrip all of our
		assemblies and they now have support for generics. 

		<li><b>sn:</b> assemblies can now be signed with RSA
		key pairs ranging from 384 to 16384 bits;
	</ul>

<h3>NUnit</h3>

	<p>A copy of NUnit is now bundled with Mono.
	
<h3>Monodoc</h3>

        <p>Monodoc now defaults to use the Mozilla rendering engine to
        display its values, thanks to Mario Sopena and the Google
        Summer of Code effort and it also uses CSS to render its
        pages.

        <p>Monodoc will now also show pending contributions that you
        might have in your file system as well as including search
        support.

<h3>Debugging</h3>

	<p>A new Mono debugger will be shortly available (alpha
	releases are now available for download).
	
        <p>Sending the QUIT signal to a running Mono process will
        produce a stack trace of each thread.  This is a long
        requested feature to assist folks debugging multi-threaded
        applications (Zoltan).
		
<h3>Unsupported Features</h3>

	<p>Code Access Security was greatly developed in this release,
	but a couple of JIT supporting routines are still missing, and
	no audit has been done of the class libraries and the runtime
	to advertise it as a working feature.

	<p>See the slides from <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/meeting06/Security_Final.pdf">security
	presentation</a> at the Mono meeting for details.
 
<h3>Relocatable</h3>

        <p>Mono is now relocatable.  This means that a Mono package or
        RPM can be relocated to any directory and will continue to
        work.  This works on Linux systems and Solaris 10.

        <p><b>Important:</b> If you embed Mono, you must now call the
        can call instead mono_assembly_setrootdir($libdir) and
        mono_set_config_dir ($sysconfdir) to set the library directory
        and the system configuration directories.
