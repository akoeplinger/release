<h1>Mono 1.0.5 Release Notes</h1>

	<p>For detailed information about Mono, please see the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0/">Mono 1.0</a>
	release notes.

	<p>Mono 1.0.5 is a maintenance release release for the 1.0
	series of the Mono runtime.  The Mono 1.0.xx series is the
	edition of stable releases of the Mono runtime.

<a name="new"><h2>New In Mono 1.0.5</h2></a>

	<p>There are many bug fixes, optimizations and scalability
	fixes that have been backported from the Mono 1.1.xx releases,
	but in addition:

<h3>MonoDoc</h3>

	<p>MonoDoc now includes the new MonkeyGuide from Shane,
	cleaned up and simplified.

	<p>Joshua updated the <tt>monodocer</tt> tool, and by
	extension the documentation has been updated and improved for
	various classes.

	<p>Plenty of updated API documentation for Gtk# developers. 

	<p>The only bad news is that currently the Gtk# tutorial is
	not shipped as it needs to be reviewed for correctness against
	Gtk# 1.0 (it was wrong in a few places).
	
<h3>XSP server</h3>

	<p>The XSP server performance has been increased by supporting
	keep-alive connections.  Despite being only a testing server,
	it was being used by a few sites.

<h3>Monodoc</h3>

	<p>Atsushi ported monodoc's ASP.NET interface so it works on
	Windows now.

	<p>Monodoc now can convert the output of the C# compiler -doc
	switch into ECMA XML documentation, so you can browse it with
	monodoc (command line option --cs-to-ecma).

<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>Endian fixes for Authenticode and NTLM (OSX, SPARC).

	<p>Fixed RC4 to work under MS FX 2.0 runtime (empty IV);

	<p>Fixed padding for keys that aren't a multiple of 8 bits
	(e.g. a 1023 bits public key);

	<p>Added support for SSLv2 ClientHello message to allow FireFox, IE and
	wget to work with SslServerStream (Carlos, Sebastien);

	<p>Added key blinding (on by default) to RSAManaged to avoid possible
	timing attacks (Sebastien).

<h3>ADO.NET</h3>

	<p>Dan improved Sqlsharp tool to load data providers from the
	Mono GAC, this is using the Mono.Data demultiplexor
	(ProviderFactory).
