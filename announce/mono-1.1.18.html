<h1>Mono 1.1.18 Release</h1>

	<p>Mono was branched at version 1.1.13 to become the stable
	version of Mono that is distributed by Novell on its
	enterprise products.   That series of releases are only
	getting bug fixes.

	<p>Before each release we run all of the regression tests on
	Mono, so we consider this release usable for deployment, but
	there are still a few changes in various areas.  
	
	<p>All of the changes since 1.0 are documented in the
	following release notes: <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>, <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>, <a

	few new developments.

<a name="new"/>

<h1>Changes since Mono 1.1.17</h1>

	<p>Runtime and C# will now correctly list all generic
	interfaces implemented by a given method;  This fixes several
	bugs in the C# generics support as well as in the class
	libraries [Martin Baulig]

<h3>New IO Portability Layer</h3>

	<p>This release includes Dick's Porter portability layer into
	Mono that will address those problems without requiring
	changes to your code.  This will remove a large component of
	the porting cycle as a whole class of obnoxious problems are
	gone.

	<p>The new portability framework is enabled by setting the
	environment variable <tt>MONO_IOMAP</tt> (which
	we will likely rename to something shorter) to one of the
	following values:

	<ul>
	<li><tt>case</tt>: makes all file system access case
	insensitive.
	
	<li><tt>drive</tt>: strips drive name from pathnames.
	
	<li><tt>all</tt>: enables both <tt>case</tt> and
	<tt>drive</tt>.
	</ul>

	<p>In addition, if any of those options are enabled, the
	directory separator mapping is also turned on.  So this
	basically means that you have to type this, or include this in
	your script that launches your application:

	<pre>
	$ export MONO_IOMAP=all
	$ mono myapp.exe</pre>

	<p>For ASP.NET applications hosted with mod_mono, you can add
	the following directive to your Apache configuration file:

	<pre>
	MonoSetEnv MONO_IOMAP=all</pre>

<h3>Security</h3>

	<p> Major speed improvements (as much as 10x) for Rijndael
	[Kazuki Oikawa];

	<p>SSL/TLS can now renegotiate security parameters during an 
	existing session [Sebastien Pouliot]
    
	<p>SSL/TLS optimizations by reducing memory allocations,
	creating less objects, like streams (in general) and
	transforms (while encrypting) for block ciphers.  It now only
	allocates one third of the memory it used to allocate, which
	has a nice performance side effect [Sebastien Pouliot]

	<p>HTTPS session now honor
	ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol to control SSLv3 and/or
	TLSv1 sessions. [Sebastien Pouliot]

	<p>Couple of bug fixes to XML Signature and XML Encryption
	[Gert Driesen, Atsushi Enomoto]
    
<h3>Mono Documentation</h3>

	<p>MonoDoc now has generics support and will display generic
	types [Jonathan Pryor] and now documents custom attributes
	with their actual constructor calls, and monodocs2html now
	includes inherited members on type pages [Joshua Tauberer].

<h3>Windows.Forms update</h3>

	<p>There have been over 100 bugs fixed in Windows.Forms and
	System.Drawing by the Winforms team and Mono contributors.

	<p>2.0 ToolStrip and FlowLayout from Jonathan Pobst.

	<p>Plenty of stability work on Windows.Forms, some of the
	changes include:

	<ul>
              <li> TextBox (jackson, eno)
              <li> FileDialog (alex)
              <li> PropertyGrid (jchambers, various others)
              <li> ListView (mkestner, Gert)
              <li> DataGrid (toshok)
              <li> NotifyIcon (jackson, toshok)
              <li> MDI (jackson)
              <li> Focus (jackson, andreia)
              <li> Splitter (toshok)
              <li> TreeView (jackson)
              <li> WM styles (toshok)
              <li> ComboBox (mkestner)
        </ul>

	<p>Printing support in System.Drawing [Jordi Mas]
	
<h3>Support for the #- heap</h3>

	<p>The #- heap is a heap used for "incremental" builds in
	Visual Studio and its usually only used with debugging builds.
	In the past Mono has not been able to cope with binaries that
	had this table.

	<p>Zoltan implemented the support for this feature, which
	means that it is no longer necessary to tell developers to
	rebuild their software without the incremental flag.

	<p>Also, some compilers did not offer the option to create
	regular executables (ISE Eiffel for example), so this feature
	will allow these applications to run on Mono unmodified.

	<p>This is one of the oldest bugs in Mono (#38532).

	
<h3>ServiceProcess</h3>

	<p>An implementation of the ServiceProcess APIs for Win32,
	previously we only had this available on Linux [Gert Driesen].
	
<h3>Platform Support</h3>

	<p>Updated Alpha port, it is now able to bootstrap itself, but
	there are still known limitations in the port.  The port is
	now considered a beta port. [Sergey Tikhonov]

	<p>Initial support for the new ABI on the Nokia 770 for
	floating point operations (This is still a work in progress)
	as well as various fixes for better supporting the ARM
	processors as well as the long standing exception bugs .
	[Paolo Molaro].

<h3>Tuning</h3>

	<p>Reduced the size of our string collation tables [Paolo
	Molaro].

	<p>Improved the performance of Rijndael encryption from 2Mb/s
	to 21.9Mb/s (in our measures its 2.89 to 12.99 speed increase
	depending on key size) [Kazuki Oikawa].

	<p>We identified a poll that was being used every 100ms that
	is now eliminated.

	<p>Reduced runtime relocations and some internal data
	structures [Paolo Molaro]

	<p>5% performance increase on array creation operations [Paolo
	Molaro].

<h3>2.0 support</h3>

	<p>It is now possible to apply the new [SpecialName] attribute
	[Paolo Molaro]

<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<p>mod_mono fix for virtual hosts and auto-hosting [Joshua
	Tauberer] 
	
	<p>Continued work on improving our ASP.NET 2.0 support, but it
	is still not complete, it still makes up for a large part of
	changes for this release [Mainsoft team, Gonzalo Paniagua,
	Marek Habersack]

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>The mcs and gmcs code bases have now been unified, which
	will help us reduce our maintenance cost of the two compilers.
	Only the tokenizers and parsers remain split [Martin Baulig,
	Harinath Raja]

	<p>Redesign of the anonymous method and iterator
	infrastructure, this fixes all open anonymous methods bugs as
	well as countless problems that were lurking on the previous
	design [Martin Baulig]

	<p>Support for <tt>default(T)</tt> expressions and constant
	extraction for <tt>default(T)</tt> is supported, so the
	compiler is now able to do constant folding on these
	expressions [Marek].

	<p>The compiler will now detect
	<tt>NullReferenceException</tt> for code like this [Marek]:

	<pre>
         void Foo<T> (T t) where T : class
         {
             System.Console.WriteLine (t.ToString ());
         }</pre>

	 <p>New IntPtr and UIntPtr conversions supported.  These were
	 not on the C# specification as they were intended to be
	 explicit operator definitions on the IntPtr and UIntPtr
	 classes but due to historical reasons (see the bug <a
	 href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=59800">59800</a>
	 for Microsoft's explanation) the conversions remained
	 hard-coded into the C# compiler.  MCS and GMCS now have these
	 conversions hardcoded as well.
	    
<h3>Tail call bug</h3>

	<p>There was a bug in tail call support that made certain
	constructs in F# fail, this bug has now been fixed [Zoltan].

<h3>OSX and CrashReporter</h3>

	<p>When a NullReference is caught by Mono, it will no longer
	trigger the CrashReporter (#74869), this bug was fixed by
	Robert Jordan.

	<p>A bug in the GC was fixed that caused crashes in some
	multi-threaded applications [Allan Hsu]
	
<h3>System.Drawing and GDI+</h3>

	<p>Updated libgdiplus to Cairo version 1.2.4 [Sebastien
	Pouliot]

	<p>First release with no unit test failures on big endian architectures 
	(e.g. PPC and SPARC).

	<p>Extensive rendering bug fixes, parameter checks and bug
	fixes. 

<h3>New GDB routines</h3>

	<p>New helper routines for low-level debugging with GDB to
	describe variables and parameters and objects in memory [Paolo Molaro].

	<pre style="padding: 6pt; background-color: #f6f6f6; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
	void mono_object_describe        (MonoObject *obj);
	void mono_object_describe_fields (MonoObject *obj);
	void mono_value_describe_fields  (MonoClass* klass, const char* addr);
	void mono_class_describe_statics (MonoClass* klass);
	void mono_debug_print_vars       (gpointer ip, gboolean only_arguments);</pre>

	<p>Use <tt>mono_object_describe</tt> to get a small description of
	the object obj.

	<p>Use <tt>mono_object_describe_fields</tt> to get a small description of all the fields on the given object.

	<p>Use <tt>mono_value_describe_fields</tt> to prints to stdout
	a small description of each field of the value type stored at
	@addr of type @klass.

	<p>Use <tt>mono_class_describe_statics</tt> to prints to
	stdout a small description of each static field of the type
	@klass in the current application domain.

	<p>Use <tt>mono_debug_print_vars</tt> to prints to stdout the
	information about the local variables in a method (if
	@only_arguments is false) or about the arguments.

	<p>The information includes the storage info (where the variable
	lives, in a register or in memory). The method is found by
	looking up what method has been emitted at the instruction
	address @ip.

	<p>A sample session is:

	<pre>
(gdb) r --debug --break 'System.Buffer:BlockCopy' tests/console.exe
We can now write to the console
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
[Switching to Thread -1210435904 (LWP 634)]
0xb7a2b97f in ?? ()

(gdb) call mono_pmip ($eip)
$1 = 0x8279750 " System.Buffer:BlockCopy (System.Array,int,System.Array,int,int)
    + 0x17 (0xb7a04968 0xb7a04b93) [0x21f00 - console.exe]"

(gdb) call mono_debug_print_vars ($eip, 1)
Arg src (0) in memory: base register %ebp + 8
Arg srcOffset (1) in memory: base register %ebp + 12
Arg dest (2) in register %ebx
Arg destOffset (3) in register %esi
Arg count (4) in register %edi

(gdb) call mono_object_describe (*(char**)($ebp+8))
System.Char[] at 0x43e58, rank: 1, length: 1

(gdb) call mono_object_describe ($ebx)
System.Char[] at 0x55000, rank: 1, length: 1024	</pre>

	
<h3>Debugger Binary Symbol Store</h3>

	<p>A contribution from Joachim Ante, allows debugging
	information to be embedded in a binary instead of having to
	load it from a separate file.

<h3>Ahead-of-Time Compilation</h3>

	<p>AOT compilation on selected platforms no longer requires
	the operating system assemblers and linkers, Mono will now
	generate native shared libraries on its own [Paolo Molaro].
	
<h3>Source Code</h3>

	<p>The source code in Mono has been converted to UTF-8, it is
	no longer locale-dependent (it used to be for the most part in
	Latin-1 encoding) [Kornel Pal]

<h3>P/Invoke, new features</h3>
	
	<p>It is now possible to apply P/Invoke remapping features
	based on the architecture and the operating system, this
	allows developers to ship a single <tt>.config</tt> file for
	mapping to different library names on different operating
	systems.

	<p>For examples and more information see the <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/DllMap">DllMap</a>
	documentation and the sample usage.

<h3>Mono.Posix</h3>

	<p>Drop bindings for crypt(3), encrypt(3), setkey(3).  These use an
	encryption algorithm which was broken years ago and could be cracked in
	minutes on a modern machine.  This also removes a libcrypt.so dependency,
	which means you don't need to have development packages installed to use
	these either (since "crypt" wasn't <dllmap>'d).  These are still present,
	but marked [Obsolete] and throw a SecurityException when
	invoked.

<h3>Generics</h3>

	<p>Array and other special classes properly expose the virtual
	methods that they implement.  This was originally exposed by
	the Visual Basic.NET compiler.
	
<h3>Console</h3>

	<p>Update the Console to better track the state of the screen,
	but it still is known to contain a few bugs, the console is
	also hooked up to some internal streams (to allow users that
	were manipulating the streams directly to use it) [Gonzalo
	Paniagua].

	<p>The updated Console will no longer throw an exception if
	its output is redirected.

<h3>Tools</h3>

	<p>The <tt>mkbundle</tt> tool (used to generate self-contained
	executables) now supports compressed images (-z) on Windows as
	well [Robert Jordan]

	<p>New <tt>mget</tt> testing tool for testing HTTPS downloads with
	TLS/TLS certificates and SSLv3 and TLSv2 protocols.

<h3>OracleClient</h3>

	<p>Leszek Ciesielski integrated the test suite for the
	OracleClient database library and has contributed various bug
	fixes for problems reported.

<h3>Visual Basic Runtime</h3>

	<p>Many bug fixes and improvements to the new Visual Basic
	runtime [Rafael Mizrahi, Kornel Pal, Miguel de Icaza]

	<p>Integrated old VB tests into the new implementation [Rafael
	Mizrahi].

<h3>Windows Support</h3>

	<p>The Registry API will now support Remote keys [Gert
	Driesen]
