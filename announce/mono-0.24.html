	<h3>4. Detailed Features</h3>

	<a name="runtime">
	<h4>4.1 Runtime</h4>

	<p>Zoltan changed the way objects are allocated: heap objects are
	allocated with GC descriptors which describe which fields are
	holding object references and which do not. This speeds up
	collections and decreases memory usage since fewer objects are
	mistakenly retained.</p>

	<p>The synchronized attribute is now supported.</p>

	<a name="asp">
	<h4>4.2 ASP.NET</h4>

	Gonzalo rewrote most of our ASP.NET WebForms parser.

	<p>The ASP.NET code generator uses CodeDom now so, ideally, once we
        have mbas working and someone implements an ICodeCompiler and a
        CodeDomProvider for VB.NET we will support VB.NET in aspx pages.</p>
                
	<p>ControlBuilders are supported now.  When a
	ControlBuilderAttribute is applied to a control it can modify
        the parsing behaviour beyond the posibilities offered by
        ParseChildrenAttribute (enable/disable white space literals,
        modify children as they are added, including changing their Type
        and more).  This is required to run some of the sample
	applications released at <a
	href="http://www.asp.net">http://www.asp.net</a>.</p>
                
        <p>Some improvements in error pages for parsing and compilation. We
        even mark with red color generated source lines (MS doesn't :).</p>
                
        <p>Added support for including files. This can save some typing
        when headers, footers or whatever are reused in more than one
        page/control.</p>

	<a name="mcs">
	<h4>4.3 C# Compiler</h4>

	<p>Many bugs have been fixed, and various speed improvements
	added.  Zoltan added a change to reduce memory consumption,
	which reduced the compilation times.  A cache that was
	underutilized has been fully activated, and the total speedup
	is 40%.  Now MCS bootstraps itself in 6.3 seconds on a 1.8GHz
	Mobile P4.</p>

	<p>Iterators in classes are supported now.  This is a feature
	from the upcoming C# 2.0 release, it has not been wildly
	tested.  To use iterators, pass the -v2 flag to the compiler.
	Notice that code that uses iterators will not compile with the
	current Microsoft compiler.</p>

	<p>Iterators were prototyped for C# by Todd Proebsting, and
	they vastly simplify the implementation of enumerators in
	classes.  Instead of being a tedious task, the results is that
	you can not wait to add enumerable support to the simplest of
	your classes.</p>

	<p>A few samples are included in mcs/tests/2*.cs, but you can
	also read the article at MSDN: <a
	href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/vbconCProgrammingLanguageFutureFeatures.asp">C#
	Programming Language Future Features</a>.
	
	<a name="remoting">
	<h4>4.4 Remoting</h4>

	<p>Lluis continues to improve the Remoting infrastructure:</p>

	<P>Implemented support for Contexts and ContextBoundObjects,
	including all context message sinks.</p>

	<p>Support for interfaces and abstract classes in proxies.</p>
	
	<p>The TCP channel and the binary formatter are now compatible
	with MS.NET.</p>

	<p>OneWay methods are now working.</p>
	
	<a name="xml">
	<h4>4.5 XML</h4>

	<p>The first implementation of XML deserialization has been
	done. It's not complete but XmlSerializer has now become
	somewhat symmetric.</p>

        <p>Mono now ships Atsushi's RELAX NG validating XmlReader for
	XML (namespace: Commons.Xml.Relaxng).  This is also the first
	XML validation engine for Mono.</p>

	<p>Dogfooding-wise: We are using a Relax-NG schema and a
	simple program to validate our documentation now.</p>

	<p>XmlTextReader has many improvements.  XmlTextReader now can
	parse a supplied inline or external DTD (only infiles for
	now).  It is also capable of auto encoding detection for its
	input.</p>

        <p>XmlNodeReader has also improved to be compatible with 
        XmlTextReader.</p>

	<p>Alan added support for passing arguments to XSLT
	transformations</p>

	<a name="winforms">
	<h4>4.6 Windows.Forms</h4>

	<p>So far, Windows.Forms development has continued by using a
	special version of the runtime that is linked to Wine.  This
	is about to change.  Vlad from <a
	href="http://www.openlinksw.com">OpenLink</a> has modified
	Wine to be used as a library, and this new version of Wine has
	no interaction problems with the Mono GC and works without
	making changes to the Mono runtime.  So the same runtime can
	be used to run any kind of applications.</p>

	<p>Alexandre and Aleksey have been very busy at work with
	Windows.Forms, and have done a lot of progress here.

	<p><b>Improvements to Control/Form architecture:</b>
        Layout management, MDI implementation, menu merging,
        modal forms, user paint.</p>

	<p><b>Implementation added to controls:</b>
        Button, ComboBox, CheckedListBox, DomainUpDown, Form, 
        GroupBox, NumericUpDown, Label, ListBox, Panel, ProgressBar,
        RadioButton, StatusBar, StatusBarPanel,
        TabControl, TabPage, TextBox, TrackBar and ToolTip.
	
	<a name="glob">
	<h4>4.7 Globalization</h4>

	<p>Alan added support for two Chinese encodings: Big5 and
	GB2312.</p>

	<p>Duncan has been working on getting our CultureInfo
	completed.  Currently we have checked in stubs for various XML
	files that describe the various characteristics of the
	CultureInfo.  Currently they all contain the information for
	English, so we will need people to help provide translations
	and localization to these files.</p>
	
	<a name="jit">
	<h4>4.8 New Code Generation Engine</h4>

	<p>This release contains the new code generation engine that
	Dietmar and Paolo have been working on for the past seven
	months.   This new code generator can be used both as a
	just-in-time compiler or a CIL pre-compiler.</p>

	<p>The new engine had a number of goals:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Simplify porting the JIT engine.

		<li>Provide a solid framework for implementing advanced
		optimizations in the JIT engine.

		<li>Support ahead-of-time compilation (precompilation).
	</ul>
	
	<p>The new code generator replaces `mono' as our JIT
	engine.  The old JIT engine is still distributed as `oldmono',
	but will be phased out.</p>

	<p>In JIT mode, you have to run it like this:
	<pre>
	mono program.exe</pre>

	<p>In pre-compiler mode you first need to pre-compile your
	assembly.  You do that by passing the --aot flag:</p>

	<pre>
	mono --aot program.exe
	mono --aot mylibrary.dll</pre>

	<p>That will generate <tt>program.exe.so</tt> and
	<tt>mylibrary.dll.so</tt> respectively.  These contain the
	precompiled code.  Then to execute your precompiled binary,
	invoke the compiler like this:</p>

	<pre>
	mono program.exe</pre>

	<p>The runtime will automatically pick up the precompiled
	binaries as long as they are in the same directory as the
	original assembly.</p>
	
	<p>We are very happy with the new framework, because it is
	very modular, and it allows us to cleanly replace in the
	future components of it, if we choose to, or revamp components
	of it.  The new code generator has also an SSA representation
	that is the foundation for plenty of optimizations today and
	in the future.</p>

	<p>The following optimizations are implemented:</p>
	<ul>
		Branch optimizations, 
		conditional moves,
		constant folding,
		constant propagation,
		copy propagation,
		dead code elimination,
		emit per-domain code,
		fast x86 FP compares,
		inline method calls,
		instruction scheduling,
		intrinsic method implementations,
		linear scan global reg allocation,
		loop related optimizations,
		peephole postpass,
		tail recursion and tail calls
	</ul>

	<p>A whitepaper on the internals of the new compilation
	engine is available on mono/mini/mini-doc.txt, if you are
	interested in understanding the new engine, this document is a
	good starting point.</p>

	<p>The job of doing a good JIT requires a tradeoff between
	compilation speed and code generation quality.  Some are
	computing-time expensive and some are cheap.  In JIT mode, we
	only turn on a few optimizations, but you might want to turn
	them all on when doing pre-compilations (-O=all, see the
	mono man page for details).</p>

	<p>The new JIT engine is closer to the spec so plenty of
	checks and tests that were not implemented before, are
	implemented now.</p>

	<p>We can now focus on tuning the performance of the JIT engine</p>
	
	<a name="new">
	<h4>4.9 New Tools</h4>

	<p><b>cilc:</b> Alp Toker has provided us with <tt>cilc</tt>,
	a tool that can generate C bindings to any assembly.  This
	tool is useful if you want to reuse managed code from your C
	application.  This is typically used by those who <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/embedded-api.html">embed</a> the
	Mono runtime into their existing C code.</p>

	<p>This is of particular interest to Gnome developers, as they
	can now easily import new widgets written in C# into their
	applications.</p>

	<p><b>monoxsd:</b> Duncan has started work on our XSD
	replacement.  Currently its limited to generating an XML
	schema out of an assembly.</p>

	<p><b>Security tools:</b> Sebastien has added a few tools to
	use the cryptographic support libraries in Mono, like the
	certificate creation tool.  You can see a screenshot of the
	<a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/images/gtk-certview.png">Certificate viewer</a>
	
	<a name="ongoing">	
	<h4>4.10 Ongoing Projects</h4>

	<p>Jackson continues work on our IL assembler.  The IL
	assembler has most of the high-level features now, and 50% of
	the instruction set is handled.  The next release should have
	a complete version.</p>
	
	<p>Cesar continues work on our JScript compiler.  All of the
	public class contracts in the Microsoft.JScript namespace are
	there, and the parser is mostly done.  Work is underway to
	emit dynamic assemblies.</p>

	<p>Work has begun on making the SOAP client support in Mono
	functional.  To this end, we are starting to re-architect the
	XmlSerialization infrastructure, which had not been maintained
	for a while.  We will be devoting significant effort in
	getting the Web services client functional now.</p>

	<a name="mbas">
	<h4>4.11 Mono Basic</h4>

	<p>Marco Ridoni has been making a lot of progress in Mono
	Basic.  Also Rafael has added preprocessor support to it.
	Here is a full list of new features:
	<ul<g
		<li>Compound operators added
		<li>Member access now work correctly
		<li>A lot of array fixes/improvements
		<li>LateIndexGet/Set calls are generated correctly
		<li>Overloading in constructors fixed
		<li>Array access when the array is a parameter fixed
		<li>Invocation resolution improved
		<li>Added readonly modifier for properties
	</ul>

	<a name="security">
	<h4>4.12 Security</h4>

	<p>Sebastien has continued improving the security classes.
	Not only we have convinced him to use Linux, but he has also
	wrote his first two .NET GUI applications: one SWT, one Gtk#.</p>

	<p>The RSA and DSA code are faster, and also the whole security
	system uses Ben's updated BigInteger code.  The new BigInteger
	code is a lot faster.</p>
	
	<h4>Special Thanks</h4>

	Special thanks go to Duncan Mak for helping putting together
	this release.
