<h1>Mono 1.2.4 Release, 2007</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.2.4 is an update to <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.3">Mono 1.2.3</a> in
	the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2">Mono 1.2
	series</a>, it is a bug fix release for all the supported
	components, but also includes updates on the 2.0 stack.
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#changes">Changes since version 1.2.3</a>
		<li><a href="#install">Download and installation.</a>
		<li><a href="#contributors">Contributors to this release.</a>
	</ul>

	<p>All of the changes since 1.2 are documented in the
	following release notes:

	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.1">1.2.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.2">1.2.2</a> and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.3">1.2.3</a>.
	
<a name="changes">
<h1>New in Mono 1.2.4</h1>

	<p>Some statistics:
	
	<ul>
		<li>680 new methods implemented.

		<li>290 stubs that used to throw NotImplemented
		exceptions have been implemented. 

		<li>43 methods flagged with "to-do" have been
		implemented.
	</ul>
	
<h2>Runtime: HandleRef</h2>

	<p>Before Mono 1.2.4, runtime support for HandleRef did not
	exist.

	<p>People used to get the expected results probably as a side
	effect of the code generated, but their unmanaged code could
	have received junk.   People depending on HandleRef should
	depend on version 1.2.4 at least, if people are targetting
	versions prior to 1.2.4, they should rewrite their code to
	drop HandleRef.

<h2>Shared Memory</h2>

	<p>Support for disabling Mono's requirement to use shared
	memory is back.

	<p>Set the MONO_DISABLE_SHM environment variable at runtime,
	or you can disable it completely at configure time by passing
	the --disable-shared-handles argument to configure [Dick
	Porter]

	<p>Notice that disabling the support for shared memory
	disables some features in Mono, in particular cross-process
	IPC systems.
	
<h2>ASP.NET, in the 2.0 road</h2>

	<p>Many improvements for Mono's ASP.NET 2.0 implementation, it
	is mostly complete at this point, we are only missing support
	for WebParts on the framework side of things.   

	<ul>
		<li>Support for preservation files (.compiled files to
		allow mapping hashed dynamic assembly names to canonic
		names).
	
		<li>Preliminary support for asynchronous pages
		[Igor Zelmanovich]
		
		<li>Improved support for App_Code and
		App_{Local,Global}Resources [Marek Habersack].
		
		<li>Improved application themes/skins support [Marek
		Habersack]
		
		<li>Support for <a
		href="http://grendello.blogspot.com/2007/03/cool-underdocumented-feature-of-aspnet.html">setting
		page/control class properties declaratively</a> from
		the Page/Control directive [Marek Habersack]
	
		<li>View state encryption support [Igor Zelmanovich]
		
		<li>Code generated from .aspx and .ascx files now uses
		split-class model [Marek Habersack]
		
		<li>Correct decryption of role ticket cookies [Mike
		Morano]
		
		<li>New formatting of ASP.NET error pages (XHTML
		compliant).
		
		<li>XHTML rendering compatibility fixes [Daniel Nauck]
		
		<li>Numerous VirtualPathUtility fixes [Igor Zelmanovich]
		
		<li>System.Configuration fixes for empty containers with the short tag endings
		(e.g. &lt;system.web/&gt;) - they no longer lock up the application
	
		<li>Implemented the CodeFileBaseClass directive [Marek
		Habersack]
		
		<li>Numerous data-bound controls fixes [Igor Zelmanovich]
		
		<li>Implementation of all browser capabilities
		[Igor Zelmanovich]
		
		<li>Support for meta:resourcekey attribute in
		Page/Control directives.
		
		<li>Local resources now work with master pages.
		
		<li>The dynamic binary directory is now cleaned up at
		the application startup (unless the
		MONO_ASPNET_NODELETE environment variable is present)
		[Marek Habersack].
		
		<li>Numerous SiteMap and friends fixes [Mike Morano, Igor Zelmanovich]
		
		<li>Support for custom errors [Marek Habersack]
		
		<li>Fixes to file watcher when using inotify support
		on Linux systems [Marek Habersack]
	</ul>
	
	<p>Support for the "Bin" directory [Marek Habersack]

<h2>ASP.NET Performance</h2>

	<p>Performance was trippled while serving ASP.NET 2.0 pages,
	a number of things were done:

	<p>A bottleneck in browser detection has been removed [Marek
	Habersack]

	<p>Server  variables are  now  also  loaded lazily  and
	internal string  comparisons always use  the invariant culture
	[Vladimir Krasnov].
	
<h2>ASP.NET WebServices</h2>

	<p>Support for 2.0 WebService/WebMethods on interfaces as well
	as support for 2.0 validation [Konstantin Triger].
	
<h2>C#</h3>

	<p>Work to support C# 3.0 has started, this release includes:

	<p>C# 3.0 Extension methods implemented by Marek Safar.  

	<p>Anonymous Method generic type inferencing by Marek Safar.
	
	<p>Lambda Expressions, implemented by Miguel de Icaza.  It is
	currently missing generic method type inferencing (similar in
	spirit to anonymous method generic type inferencing).

	<p>Martin Baulig and Marek Safar fixed many of the compiler
	bugs reported so far. 

<h2>Beta: <a
href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_DataConvert">Mono.DataConvert</a></h2>

	<p>We are shipping a new class: <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_DataConvert">Mono.DataConvert</a>
	that can be used for doing data conversion from native types
	into byte arrays and back, as well as providing little and big
	endian conversions in the process.

	<p>This class resolves the ambiguities and mistakes that the
	.NET Framework System.BitConverter has and we advocate that
	people use this over the System.BitConverter.

	<p>In addition to a variety of static methods, this API comes
	with a Pack() and Unpack methods that can do encoding and
	decoding using a list of instructions (inspired by Perl's pack
	and unpack statements).

	<p>Documentation and examples are available <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_DataConvert">here</a>
	[Miguel de Icaza].
	
<h2>Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>Over 150 reported bugs fixed.

	<p>Delay control handle creation and do fewer layouts,
	boosting performance.

	<p>2.0 support: ToolStrip overflow, merging, shortcut keys,
	tooltips, new layouts.

	<p>2.0 support: Balloon tips in NotifyIcons [Everaldo Canuto]
	
	<p>2.0 support: Hundreds of new 2.0 methods implemented in
	various controls.

<h2>System.Drawing</h2>

	<p>Metafiles (WMF and EMF) are now supported by GDI+ and
	System.Drawing.  Mono is now able to render images stored in
	metafile formats and play them back on a graphics context.
	Not all the metadata records types are supported, so you still
	need to test your software [Sebastien Pouliot].

	<p>libgdiplus has been updated to use Cairo 1.4.2 which offers
	improved performance [Sebastien Pouliot].
	
	<p>Libgdiplus symbols exports have been cleaned. This removes
	the possible mixup between gtk+/cairo and libgdiplus/cairo
	seen in recent distros [Sebastien Pouliot].
	
	<p>System.Drawing performance improvements where made for Pen
	(bad caching) and Color (lock removal) [Sebastien Pouliot].
	
	<p>Bitmap.[L|Unl]ockBits now works for all supported pixel
	formats [Sebastien Pouliot].
	
	<p>Unit tests do not expose architecture-specific issues
	anymore (e.g. endian issues on PPC and SPARC) [Sebastien Pouliot]

	<p>Many printing issues have been fixed in this release
	[Andreia Gaita].

<h2>ADO.NET</h2>

	<p>2.0 API updates (get full list from Nagappan).

	<p>FIXME: Get updates from Andreia and Nagappan.

	<p>Support for output parameters in stored procedures [Andreia Gaita]. 

<h2>New Platform Configuration</h2>

	<p>Solaris/amd64 is now supported in Mono.

<h2>Visual Basic.NET</h2>

	<p>Fixes to enable VB.NET-based application to work with
	ASP.NET [Rolf Bjarne].

	<p>VBNC now supports the My namespace [Rolf Bjarne].
	
<h2>Security and Cryptography</h2>

	<p>Path.GetTempFileName will now return a file with 600
	permissions, this is similar to new implementations of
	mkstemp.

	<p>Fixed HMACSHA384 and HMACSHA512 to use a 128 bits block
	size. The workaround is similar to MS one at <a
	href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnfa/archive/2007/01/31/please-do-not-use-the-net-2-0-hmacsha512-and-hmacsha384-classes.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnfa/archive/2007/01/31/please-do-not-use-the-net-2-0-hmacsha512-and-hmacsha384-classes.aspx</a>
	[Sebastien Pouliot]
	
	<p>Signcode tool now support password-protected PVK files
	[Sebastien Pouliot]
	
	<p>CryptoStream.Write is now closer to MS behaviour and
	requires less memory allocations [Sebastien Pouliot]
	
	<p>Fixed endian issue in RIPEMD160 [Sebastien Pouliot]

<h2>New Tool</h2>

	<p><b>installvst</b> is a tool that you can use to install
	VisualStudio source packages (e.g. starter kits) that use the
	.vstemplate files to define their installation layout.

	<p>You can use this to install the Starter Kits from
	http://asp.net. 

<h2>System.Core</h2>

	<p>Many updates to the System.Linq, System.Linq.Expressions
	APIs from the 3.5 preview [Antonello Provenzano, Marek Safar].
	
<h2>Sqlite bindings</h2>

	<p>In addition to the old Mono.Data.SqliteClient, we are now
	also shipping a new Sqlite binding Mono.Data.Sqlite.
	Mono.Data.Sqlite is <a
	href="http://sqlite-dotnet2.sourceforge.net">Robert Simpson's
	Sqlite binding</a> for .NET adapted to ship with the Mono
	framework.

	<p>This binding is better maintained than our old version.
	Developers are encouraged to migrate to this new API but keep
	in mind that this provider will only work with Sqlite3, it
	will not work with Sqlite2.

	<p>If you had your databases running with Sqlite2, and wanted
	to upgrade to the new API (which requires Sqlite3), you would
	have to dump and reload the databases.

	<p>The new assembly entirely separates the 1.x and 2.0
	codebases which affects the users of the 2.0 profile because
	of API changes required to match the ADO.NET 2.0 standard. The
	1.x profile is untouched (except for removing 2.0 fragments
	from it).

	<p>In order to allow the developers to adjust their
	applications to the new 2.0 API, the new assembly is named
	Mono.Data.Sqlite. The old assembly is being provided under its
	original name with no changes to the code.  Developers using the 2.0
	Mono profile are encouraged to switch their applications to the new
	module.

<h2>Visual Basic</h2>

<h2>Monodoc</h2>

<h2>COM</h2>

	<p>COM Interop now supports COM Callable Wrappers (CCWs),
	meaning that managed objects can be marshalled to unmanaged
	code as COM objects. [Jonathan Chambers]
	
<h2>Sockets</h2>

	<p>Many of the new 2.0 socket methods are now available in
	Mono [Dick Porter].
