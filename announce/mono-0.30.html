<h1>Mono 0.30, MonoDoc 0.10, XSP 0.9, mod_mono 0.7, libgdiplus 0.1</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>

	<p>A new release of <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> has been released.
	Mono is an open source implementation of the .NET Framework
	for Unix, Linux and Windows systems.

	<p>This release includes four components at once: the Runtime
	and Software Development Kit, the Documentation browser, and
	the ASP.NET server with its Apache module.  Packages for
	various distributions are also available from our download
	page.</p>

	<p>This is mostly a fine tuning release: bug fixing and
	performance improvements are the major benefits, but new
	classes and new features are also included.  See the rest of
	the notes for details.

	<h3>Stats</h3>

	<p>Since the last release, 2,655 individual commits were done to
	our runtime and class libraries.</p>

	<p>1,397 bugzilla bugs were closed, four times as much as in
	the previous release cycle.  So this is certainly a bug fixing
	release ;-)</p>

	<h3>Thanks</h3>

	<p>A big thank goes again for Duncan Mak who worked steadily to
	get every new dependency of Mono compiled and tested on our
	Linux Platforms and to Dan Morgan who tested our Windows build
	and produced packages for us.

<h2>Availability</h2>
	
	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>

	 <p><b>Ports:</b>
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>Ports of popular open source applications are now
	maintained here: <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/ports/">http://www.go-mono.com/ports/</a>.
	 </blockquote>
	
	 <p><b>Dependencies</b>

	 <p>If you are installing from source code, there are a few
	 optional dependencies that you will want to consider
	 installing.

	 <blockquote>
	 <p><b>icu 2.6.1</b> Required for supporting international
	 information.  Strongly recommended.

	 <p><b>libgdiplus 0.1</b> Required if you want to use
	 System.Drawing APIs.

	 <p><b>Cairo 0.1.17 </b> Required to install libgdiplus
	 
	 </blockquote>

	 <p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>

	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	source code is very simple:

	<p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
$ tar xzf mono-0.30.tar.gz
$ cd mono-0.30
$ ./configure
$ make install</pre>

	<p>libgdiplus:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
$ tar xzf libgdiplus-0.1.tar.gz
$ cd libgdiplus-0.1
$ ./configure
$ make install</pre>

	 </blockquote>

<h2>Performance</h2>

	<p>Many improvements to the class libraries (Patrik, Ben), JIT
	compiler (Paolo, Patrik, Zoltan) and C# compiler (Ben,
	Benjamin and Miguel).   The net results are that C#
	compilation times are now 30% to 40% faster than in 0.29
	(30% for plain, 40% for precompiled).

	<p>There are some nice low-level optimizations done in the
	JIT, from inlining string-length, to optimizing the
	object.GetType() call.

	<p>For instance the C# compiler will compile itself in 2.3
	seconds on a 1.6GHz machine (20klines/second).

	<p>The whole system uses less memory now, and lots of pieces
	have been better tuned: ArrayList enumerators now use less
	memory; Patrik rewrote StringBuilder; FileStreams no longer
	use locking (Ben); the BinaryReader and BinaryWriter handle
	strings more efficiently (Ben) and Gonzalo reduced the use of
	memory in Reflection.

	<p>MonoDevelop has been a source of inspiration for areas that
	have not been optimal in the past.

<h2>PowerPC port</h2>

	<p>Most tests now work on both MacOS X and LinuxPPC.  Neither
	of them are ready for production use, but most simple programs
	will run with the JIT.

	<p>On MacOS X 10.2 and 10.3, we know that ICU currently is
	causing problems, and you will need to install the latest
	alpha version of <a
	href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/">Boehm
	GC</a>.
		
<h2>C# Compiler</h2>

	<p>The code generated by the compiler is much better in the
	presence of complex conditional expressions (thanks to Ben) and
	code generation has been fixed in various new corner cases
	that we mis-compiled before.

	<p>A large part of the performance of the compiler comes from
	its more conservative use of memory.  The compiler should
	perform better as well on machines with limited amounts of
	memory.  In the bootstrapping case, the compiler is down to 50
	megs of memory.

	<p>The file format for the symbol table is much smaller as
	well (Martin).

	<p>Implicit method group conversions to Delegate types is
	available if you run the compiler with the -2 option, so this
	means that you can write less code:

	<pre class="code-csharp">
	// Before
	ok_button.Clicked += new ButtonEventHandler (ok_clicked);

	// Now
	ok_button.Clicked += ok_clicked;</pre>

<h2>VB Compiler and JScript</h2>

	<p>Rafael contributed many updates to the grammar, and Anirban
	contributed many more tests to exercise the compiler now as
	well as many bug reports as a result of all these tests based
	on the published VB specification.

	<p>Cesar has got the basics of his compiler to generate IL for
	some basic expressions now, with various tests as well. 

<h2>Mono Runtime Changes.</h2>

	<p>Zoltan added support for unmanaged resources to the
	runtime, reflection emit and the C# compiler (/win32res: and
	/win32icon: are now supported).

	<p>Zoltan also added support for declarative security to our
	Reflection.Emit implementation as well as debugging
	information in Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiled programs.

	<p>Patrik implemented Stack spilling of floating point support
	in JIT for x86.  This means that we now support complex
	floating point operations on 86 via the new floating point
	stack code.

<h2>FileSystemWatcher is here!</h2>

	<p>Gonzalo implemented the long-awaited FileSystemWatcher for
	Mono.  If your system support FAM, it will take
	advantage of it, if not, it will create a thread and
	periodically poll the underlying system for changes.

	<p>This means that our ASP.NET finally can recompile
	applications when configuration or source code changes happen
	without any delays.
	
<h2>Cryptography</h2>

	<p>Mono.Security.Win32 is working again thanks to Patrik
	Torstensson(callingconv).</p>

	<p>Runtime RNG now works under Windows
	(using CryptoAPI) thanks to Mark Crichton.</p>

	<p>Fixed MACTripleDES for 1.1 (which in some case has
	different results than 1.0)- Fixed some cases for None and
	Zeros padding modes in symmetric encryption (Sebastien).</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>Many new unit tests for permissions and code groups which
	resulted in lots of small patches in System.Security
	namespace.

	<p>Fixed lots of method signatures differences to match 1.1
	(not yet perfect)

	<p>NET 1.2- More stuff for 1.2 compatibility (PKCS,
	X509Certificate) including PKCS#12 decoding.

<h2>Web Services</h2>

	<p>Regarding web services, this is mainly a bug fixing
	release.  Many bugfixes in all areas: web services, xml
	serialization, wsdl processing,document discovery, etc.
	Thanks for all the bug reports!   And thanks to Lluis for
	promptly fixing them all.

	<p>Lluis has also deployed a new web service test suite that
	will help ensure that Mono is interoperable with other web
	service platforms.  The test suite currently processes more
	than 350 WSDL documents from various SOAP implementation which
	it generates around 600 proxies.
	
	<p>Implemented support for Dynamic Discovery documents
	(.vsdisco files).

	<p>The web service documentation page has been improved: now
	it can render sample requests and responses for all of the
	supported protocols.

	<p>This feature has also been added to the <tt>wsdl</tt> tool,
	which means that you can print sample textual
	requests/responses for all web services, not just Monoweb
	services.
	
	<xmp class="shell">
$ wsdl -sample:Register http://www.go-mono.com/docs/server.asmx?wsdl
Mono Web Services Description Language Utility
Fetching http://www.go-mono.com/docs/server.asmx?wsdl

Sample request message:

POST /docs/server.asmx
SOAPAction: http://tempuri.org/Register
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: string
Host: string

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"

  <soap:Body>
    <Register xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">
      <login>string</login>
    </Register>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
[...]
$ _
</xmp>

	<p>Useful if you want to use shell scripts to write your web
	clients.
	
<h2>XML land</h2>

	<p>We have finally switched to managed XSLT as our XSLT
	engine, this replaced the older <tt>libxslt</tt> based
	implementation.  Atsushi has implemented the missing features
	and fixed all the remaining bugs.  He added support for
	<tt>msxsl:script</tt> as well as extensions objects.

	<p>This managed XSLT implementation is very robust.  We have
	integrated various XSLT test suites into the tree to verify
	its conformance continuously.

	<p>XML Schema: David has been improving facet validation
	support and it became much more close to MS.NET.

	<p>Schema component properties, compilation engine, and
	validation engine are improved.  Atsushi got nearly 20 W3C
	msxsdtest failures out of 7400 cases from this release.

	<p> Boris, Tom, and many people gave us several excellent bug
	reports that helped us improve several classes such as DOM,
	Schema and XML Resolver.

<h2>ASP.NET Web Forms</h2>

	<p>We continue with the pattern of using tests in this module
	as well.  We have integrated NUnitASP into the testing process
	for ASP.NET web pages (Gonzalo)

	<p>Support for custom error pages (Gonzalo)

	<p>Authentication (Basic, Digest, Ntlm) for client side code
	in System.Net has been implemented (Gonzalo)

	<p>Browser capabilities support has been added to ASP.NET.
	The database we ship is courtesy of http://www.GaryKeith.com
	(More Gonzalo!)

	<p>Jackson implemented Cookie-less session support and added
	support for Trace handlers (Trace.axd) to ASP.NET.

	<p>Jackson added support for ASP.NET caching to our
	implementation: partial page caching (caching of user controls)

<h2>ASP.NET Ports</h2>

	<p>Jackson has been working on porting various open source
	ASP.NET applications to run on Unix and Mono, you can find the
	ongoing ports effort <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/ports/">here</a>.

	<p>Currently these include the PetShop, FlexiWiki and DasBlog.
	
<h2>System.Drawing</h2>

	<p>Pen, Brush, Matrix and GraphicsPath implementation and bug
	fixes from Duncan and Ravindra.

	<p>Jordi fixed our BMP encoder, completed various C#-side
	components of System.Drawing.  He has started to move the font
	handling code to the libgdiplus layer.

	<p>Our GDI+ implementation has been split from the MCS source
	package, and has moved into its own package: libgdiplus

<h2>Remoting</h2>

	<p>Lluis Improved support for the SoapFormatter, including the implementation
	of the SdlServerSink remoting sink, which renders the wsdl
	document for a remote object published using http and the soap
	formatter.

	<p>Lluis also did other improvements and bug fixes, such as
	complete support for channel configuration properties, and
	better interoperability with MS.NET remoting.

<h2>Npgsql: Postgres bindings.</h2>

        <p>Initial support for connection pooling. You can use the
	connection pooling by specifying the MinPoolSize=value in the
	connection string.  The MaxPoolSize can also be specified, but
	it is not implemented yet.

	<p>Note that some logs about connection not being closed will
	be shown as a side effect of connection pool. The unmanaged
	socket is closed, but server complains and logs about the
	sundden close. Please, check <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-December/003380.html">this
	post</a> for more details about it.

	<p>Faster support of bytea binary data. Thanks Jackson Harper
	(jackson at ximian dot com) and Jonathan Gilbert (2a5gjx302 at
	sneakemail dot com).The performance for adding binary data is
	10x faster than original code :)

	<p>CommandBuilder and better Dataset support. Thanks Pedro
	Yoros (yoros at wanadoo dot es).

	<p>bearm (bearm at mail dot it) and Marcus Better (marcus at
	dactylis dot com) also helped with bug fixes in this release.
		
<h2>Tools</h2>

	<p>New Assembly Linker (<tt>al</tt>) from Zoltan Varga.

	<p>Lluis Implemented the <tt>soapsuds</tt> tool, which can
	generate schemas and client proxies for remote classes.

<h2>Windows.Forms update</h2>

	<p>There has been some momentum on the Gtk# backend for
	Windows.Forms in this release, you would need to compile
	manually and install these assemblies.

	<p>The WineLib-based version of Windows.Forms is on hold,
	while Peter Bartok is updating our patches for WineLib to the
	latest version of Wine.  Large internal changes in Wine
	rendered our previous WineLib implementation obsolete.

	<p>As part of the renewed patch, Peter is merging the Cairo
	and Xlib rendering paths to avoid the co-existence issues we
	had between WineLib and Cairo.

<h2>The people behind this release</h2>

	<p>Roughly 60 developers following developers contributed to this
	release:

	<p>Alexandre Pigolkine, Alon Gazit, Andreas Nahr, Atsushi
	Enomoto, B Anirban, Benjamin Jemlich, Ben Maurer, Bernie
	Solomon, Carlos Alberto Cortes, Cesar Octavio Lopez Nataren,
	Chris Masters, Daniel Morgan, David Sheldon, Dick Porter,
	Duncan Mak, Eduardo Garcia, Ettore Perazzoli, Francisco
	Figueiredo Jr., Gert Driesen, Gonzalo Paniagua, Hector
	E. Gomez Morales, Jackson Harper, Jan Jaros, Jean-Marc Andre,
	Jochen Wezel, Joel Basson, Joe Shaw, Johannes Roith, John
	Luke, Jonathan Gilbert, Jordi Mas, Laurent Guerby, Lluis
	Sanchez, Marek Safar, Mark Crichton, Martin Baulig, Martin
	Willemoes Hansen, Miguel de Icaza, Mike Kestner, Nick Drochak,
	Pablo Baena, Paolo Molaro, Patrik Torstensson, Pedro Abelleira
	Seco, Pedro Martinez, Peter Williams, Philip Van Hoof, Rachel
	Hestilow, Radek Doulik, Rafael Teixeira, Ravindra Kumar, Ravi
	Pratap, Richard Thombs, Sanjay Gupta, Sebastien Pouliot, S
	Umadevi, Sunil Kumar, Tim Coleman, Todd Berman, Ugo Albarello,
	Wojciech Polak, and Zoltan Varga.

	<p>This list is not complete, it is missing contributions that
	were sent to the list, as it was very hard to track the one
	million incremental line patch since the last release.

<h2>New Crew Members</h2>

	<p>Jordi Mas from Barcelona joined Novell to work on our
	implementation System.Drawing he will be working with Duncan,
	Ravindra and Sanjay.  

	<p>Sebastien Pouliot, the man behind most of the Cryptography
	and Security code in Mono joins Novell to complete this work
	in Mono as well.   Our first full time security/cryptography
	person on the team.
