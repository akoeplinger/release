	<p><b>This is a Draft for the Mono 2.0 release notes, it is
	not a final document</b>.

	<p>Mono 2.0 is an portable and open source implementation of
	the .NET framework to Unix, Windows, MacOS and other operating
	systems.

<h2>Changes Since Release 1.9</h2>

	<p>These are the major changes that happened since the 1.9
	release of Mono.

	<p>All of the changes since 1.2 are documented in the
	following release notes:

	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.1">1.2.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.2">1.2.2</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.3">1.2.3</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.4">1.2.4</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.5">1.2.5</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.6">1.2.6</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.9">1.9</a> and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.9.1">1.9.1</a>.

<h2>Runtime: Performance</h2>

	<p>The performance of operations on decimals has significally
	improved.
	
	<p>The performance of locking (Monitor.Enter/Monitor.Exit) is
	significally improved.
	
	<p>The memory usage of the runtime is reduced, especially when
	using generics.   
	
	<p>Many race conditions and threading problems were fixed,
	improving reliability.
	
	<p>Math.Min/Math.Max and some forms of
	Interlocked.CompareExhange (CAS) are now implemented using
	fast inline code on x86/amd64.

	<p>There is now a --debug=dont-free-domains option that --
	improves the performance of ASP.NET-based applications. 

<h2>Runtime: Features</h2>

	<p>Some progress has been made on the Winx64 port [Bill
	Holmes, Jonathan Chambers]

	<p>It is now possible to build the runtime using the dolt
	libtool replacement (http://dolt.freedesktop.org/) by passing
	--enable-dolt to configure, this speeds up Mono compilations
	by about 30%.
	
	<p>There is now a --debug=casts command line option to the
	runtime which turns on the reporting of better
	InvalidCastException message details.

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>Over 60 reported bugs in the compiler were fixed and
	many of the internals have been cleaned up.   Extensive
	refactoring and hardening of the C# 2.0 and 3.0 support are
	now better integrated.

	<p>A major rewrite of the anonymous method/lambda support in
	the internals of the compiler now optimizes the resulting
	code, and fixes several bugs in this area.

	<p>The compiler is now dual licensed under the MIT X11 and the
	GNU GPL version 2 (only).

	<p>The compiler now supports #pragma checksum for use with
	ASP.NET debugging and #line hidden, as well as flagging more
	compiler-generated code properly (to avoid the debugger
	single-stepping into those bits).
	
<h3>Performance Counters Implementation</h3>

	<p>Mono now has a performance counters implementation that can
	be used to monitor various statistics of Mono processes.  To
	access this API you use the
	System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter classes.

<h3>ASP.NET: VirtualPathProvider</h3>

	<p>This was one of the missing features from our ASP.NET 2.0
	implementation, we now have a it available (Marek).
	
<h3>Mixed Mode Assemblies.</h3>

	<p>Support for mixed-mode assemblies developed by Kornél Pál.
	These are assemblies that contain CIL bytecode as well as x86
	native code, generated by Microsoft's C++ compiler.

	<p>This feature is only supported for Windows.

<h3>Big Arrays</h3>

	<p>Mono now supports 64-bit indexed arrays on 64-bit systems.
	Although this is permitted by the ECMA standard, this today is
	a unique feature of Mono as .NET on Windows does not support
	64-bit array indexes.  This code was developed by Luis Ortiz
	at Interactive Supercomputing and integrated by Rodrigo
	Kumpera.

	<p>This feature is useful for developers that needs to
	manipulate very large data sets with C# arrays.   

	<p>To use this feature, you must configure Mono with
	--enable-big-arrays.
	
<h3>DTrace Support</h3>

	<p>On MacOS and Solaris Mono supports DTrace probes.

	<p>To use this feature, you must configure mono
	with --enable-dtrace.
	

<h3>ASP.NET and ADO.NET</h3>

	<p>Several changes to improve the scaling and performance of
	both ASP.NET and ADO.NET (Christian, Gonzalo, Marek,
	Varadhan). 

	<p>Increased performance is now available if you use the
	option --debug=dont-free-domains on ASP.NET sites.
