<h2>Changes Since Release 1.9</h2>

<h2>Runtime Engine</h2>

<p>The performance of operations on decimals is significally improved.

<p>The performance of locking (Monitor.Enter/Monitor.Exit) is significally improved.

<p>The memory usage of the runtime is reduced, especially when using generics.

<p>Many race conditions and threading problems were fixed, improving reliability.

<p>Math.Min/Math.Max and some forms of Interlocked.CompareExhange (CAS) are now implemented using fast inline code on x86/amd64.

<p>Some progress has been made on the Winx64 port [Bill Holmes, Jonathan Chambers]

<p>It is now possible to build the runtime using the dolt libtool replacement (http://dolt.freedesktop.org/) by passing --enable-dolt to configure.

<p>There is now a --debug=casts command line option to the runtime which turns on the reporting of better InvalidCastException message details.

<h3>Performance Counters Implementation</h3>

	<p>Mono now has a performance counters implementation that can
	be used to monitor various statistics of Mono processes.  To
	access this API you use the
	System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter classes.

<h3>ASP.NET: VirtualPathProvider</h3>

	<p>This was one of the missing features from our ASP.NET 2.0
	implementation, we now have a it available (Marek).
