<h1>Mono 1.1.15 Release</h1>

	<p>This is the second beta towards the release of Mono 1.2.   
	
	<p>Mono was branched at version 1.1.13 to become the stable
	version of Mono that is distributed by Novell on its
	enterprise products.   That series of releases are only
	getting bug fixes.

	<p>Before each release we run all of the regression tests on
	Mono, so we consider this release usable for deployment, but
	there are still a few changes in various areas.  
	
	<p>All of the changes since 1.0 are documented in the
	following release notes: <a

<h1>Changes since Mono 1.1.14</h1>

<h2>Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>Windows.Forms continues to be a focus of bug fixing in this
	release.  The bug fixes are too many to enumerate.

	<p>Peter Bartok, Mike Kestner and Jackson Harper continued to
	lead the effort to squash all the bugs being reported on the
	Mono beta.

	<p>Sebastien has joined the System.Drawing team since a few
	months ago to implement some complex components
	(non-rectangular regions) and fix some hard bugs (gradient
	brushes, matrixes, correctness, fonts, CAS support).

	<p>Winforms now supports X Input mechanisms, so its possible
	to enter international characters (Jackson).
	
	<P>Contributor Alexander Olk continues to improve various of
	the themes on his spare time.

	<p>Gonzalo (of ASP.NET fame) started helping the Windows.Forms
	team to run his favorite chess application on Mono
	(ImageListStreamer, Registry changes).
	
<h2>Assembly Unloading</h2>

	<p>Zoltan implemented assembly unloading when an appdomain is
	released.

<h2>ASP.NET</h2>

	<p>Chris implemented MembershipProviders (currently only MS
	SQL server is supported, support for other databases will come
	soon);  Register directives in Skin files and the Theme
	compiler. 

	<p>The ASP.NET 2.0 regressions are now fixed (In Mono 1.1.14
	ASP.NET tests ran under the 2.0 server would crash).

	<p>Lluis updated the Tree controls to work again on our
	evolving ASP.NET 2.0 implementation.
	
<h2>C# Compiler Bug Fixes</h2>

	<p>Most of these fixes are from Marek Safar, which deserves
	some special thanks for relentlessly addressing these compiler
	bugs. 
	
	<p>Bug fixes for bugs #78020, #77916, #77961 (bug in custom
	attribute handling); #78048 (crash during Gtk# compilation);
	Report errors when there a missing pairing of COM and GUID
	attributes are present;   #77966 which allows for different
	components of a partial class to have explicitly stated
	accessibility vs none

	<p>Improved the CS0122 error reporting (instead of
	stating a type is not visible, it will now explain that the
	type is not accessible due to its visibility).

	<p>Improved the generated output for array initialization,
	saving a few KBs from for every assembly (Zoltan suggested
	this new approach).

	<p>Hari fixed #77958 (switch did not work with ulongs); #77929
	(private fields in nested generic containers not being
	accessible); #77954 (resolved ambiguity between generic method
	definition and generic method instance in different assembly).

<h2>Jay</h2>

	<p>Debug tables are now initialized lazily, which reduces
	memory startup time for any JAY-produced binaries (including
	our own C# compiler). 

<h2>XML NVDL and RNC</h2>

	<p>Atsushi added fixed various bugs in the NVDL and RNC
	parsers and validating readers and added tests for them (the
	tests come from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt).

	<p>Atsushi also fixed some assorted XPath bugs.

<h2>XmlSerialization</h2>

	<p>Lluis implemented both behaviors for XmlSchemas (1.1 and
	2.0 differ in that 1.1 does not allow adding two schemas with
	the same namespace).

<h2>System assembly</h2>

	<p>HttpWebRequest tests: There have been a number of evolving
	tests, but we had not mentioned it in the past.  To test
	HttpWebRequest we have created an abstract HttpServer class in
	the tests that emulates various behaviors from HTTP servers
	and simulate real life situations and problems.  We continue
	to use this test suite in this release.

	<p>Atsushi implemented the new Async operations for
	WebRequest.

	<p>Tomi Valkeinen provided the nono-exception throwing
	overloads for Socket's Send and Receive methods.

	<p>Thong Nguyen fixed a race condition in FAMWatcher (our FAM
	backend for monitoring changes to the file system).

	<P>Seo Sanghyeon provided DateTime.IsDaylightSavingTime.

	<p>Kazuki Oikawa implemented the Generic SortedDictionary and
	Atsushi provided the tests.

<h2>Corlib assembly</h2>

	<p>Updated to the Encoding classes from Atsushi and Kornel Pal.
	
<h2>2.0 Features</h2>

	<p>Atsushi implemented the StopWatch class.

	<p>Atsushi has been working on cleaning up our System public
	API to match the official 2.0 API.

	<p>Carlos continued work on the IO.Ports classes

<h2>Tests</h2>

	<p>Marek Safar improved the compiler tester and it will now print
	out the known issues along with the statistics.

	<p>New ASP.NET tests from Andrew Skiba, Konstantin Triger,
	Miguel de Icaza, Vladimir Krasnov,

	<p>New regular expression tests from Hari.

	<p>New Collections.Generic tests from Kazuki Oikawa and
	Atsushi Enomoto.

	<p>New tests from Roei Erez to validate the encoding of
	internal fields of Soap serialization against .NET.

	<p>New tests from Senganal for the System.Data changes. 

	<p>Many new tests for System.Drawing from Sebastien.
	
<h2>Performance</h2>

	<p>Joshua and Gonzalo added an optimization that reuses arrays
	on the HttpWriter instead of allocating a new buffer on each
	write.

	<p>Kazuki Oikawa improved the performance of Int32.ToString()
	(bug #77792), it reduced memory allocations and improved
	performance:

	<pre>
	IntegerFormatter before refactoring (rev. 38559)
	  c: 2297ms
	  d: 1313ms
	  f: 1343ms
	  g: 1329ms
	  e: 1843ms
	  x: 797ms

	  x: 391ms
	  Total memory allocated: 564775 KB
	</pre>
	
<h2>Important Bug Fixes</h2>

	<p>Senganal fixed #78010 (DataSet.EnforceConstraints throws
	incorrect constraint violation); #78027 (SqlCommandBuilder
	creates incorrect Update and Delete commands);

	<p>Boris Kirzner and Roei Erez fixed a SoapSerialization
	compatibility issues with .NET.
	
	<p>Many of the pending Regex bug fixes were fixed by Hari
	(#78007, #75345, #69269, #77487).

	<p>Zoltan fixed #77960 (Marshalling of fixed size char arrays
	in structs is unicode only); #78035 (make check fails due to
	errors in delegate1 and delegate2 tests);  #78087 (Runtime
	produces invalid blob for array attributes); #77916 (unhandled
	type (array for object argument) in custom attr); #78024
	(handle multiple leaves, this was exposed by some Winforms
	apps); 
	
	<p>Mono.Posix time handling: Jon Pryor fixed #78033 to take
	daylight savings time into account.
	
	<p>Marshalling bug that affected Winfows.Forms applications
	from starting up on Windows was fixed (Zoltan).

	<p>Some well known registry nodes are now created on demand
	("Software") (Gonzalo).

	<p>Multiple fixes to ImageListStreamer for Windows.Forms apps
	(Gonzalo).

	<p>Gacutil will delete assemblies before copying over them
	(this should address updating libraries the GAC on
	live-systems, Miguel).

	<p>resgen2 will now be available (Hari).

	<p>Gonzalo fixed #77971 (monitoring files in subdirectories of
	monitored directories).

	<p>Atsushi fixed the Norwegian locale problems (#69652).

<h2>SPARC Port</h2>

<h2>IO Layer</h2>

	<p>

	follow-exec and to debug multi-threaded and multi-appdomain
	applications (like xsp).
		
<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>FileIOPermissions now match the operating system path
	separators (from Sebastien).

<h2>XBuild</h2>

	<p>Continued work on XBuild from Marek Sieradzki

	<p>Crestez Leonard reorganized project loading and evaluation.
	We cleaned up our code to fit API from .NET 2.0.

	<p>New NUnit tests have been added.
