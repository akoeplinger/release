<h2>What is new in Mono 1.1.10</h2>

<h3>mod_mono <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/AutoConfiguration">Auto-Configuration</a></h3>

	<p>Mod_mono, the apache module for providing ASP.NET support
	has historically been difficult to configure and it required
	system administrators to manually register all the directories
	that contained an ASP.NET application.  This was troublesome
	for many and also stopped mod_mono from being adopted for
	multi-user systems.

	<p>mod_mono 1.1.10 features a new <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/AutoConfiguration">auto-configuration</a>
	system which allows ASP.NET applications to work without
	having to make any configuration changes to Apache.

	<p>The experience of the new auto-configuration system is
	similar to PHP: any file that has one of the ASP.NET
	extensions will automatically be handled by Mono.

	<p>The feature can be turned off if desired, see our <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/AutoConfiguration">documentation
	page</a> for more details.

<h3>mod_mono and virtual hosts</h3>

	<p>Mod_mono now works correctly with virtual hosts, and it is
	possible to use the mod_mono control panel to restart
	individual servers.

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>Control drawing performance improved (background drawing
	handling).

	<p>libgdiplus now support turning off anti-aliasing.

	<p>Drag and Drop for X11 has been implemented.

	<p>Support for auto-sizing is implemented.

	<p>Menu improvements on X11.

	<p>Extensive bug fixes.

	<p>Kornél reimplemented the ImageList control.

	<p>DataGridView widget for 2.x: by Pedro Martínez Julia,
	made possible by the Google Summer of Code and Jordi which
	acted as the mentor. 

<h3>Code Access Security</h3>

	<p>System.Drawing doesn't require permissions to call
	unmanaged code to work (big speedup when running with the
	security manager active).
	
	<p>Many CAS permissions (and tests) were added for System.dll
	and System.Webdll (work in progress);

<h3>Class library / Security</h3>

	<p>ProtectedData is now working under Mono. It use a managed
	implementation on Linux/POSIX and native DAPI (p/invoke) on
	Windows (requires Windows 2000);
	
	<p>ProtectedMemory is working on Windows (requires Windows
	2000 SP3 or later);

<h3>MozRoots</h3>

	<p>MozRoots is a new command-line tool to download and import
	the list of Mozilla's trusted root certificates into Mono's
	trust store.

	<p>Mono by default does not have any root certificates on its
	certificate store and it is up to each deployment to add the
	certificates that they trust to the store.  This has caused
	some confussion with people using TLS and SSL with Mono.  The
	MozRoots tool makes it simple to import a set of root
	certificates from Mozilla into the Mono store. 
		
<h3>Security Tools</h3>

	<P>sn: assemblies can now be signed with RSA key pairs ranging
	from 384 to 16384 bits;
	
<h3>XSP</h3>

	<P>Sebastien added support to XSP for PKCS#12 private
	key/certificates;

<h3>JavaScript compiler</h3>

	<p>From Cesar and Florian:
	
	<p>Compiler: added support for: multiple file compilation and
	import statement.

	<p>Run-time: Florian Gross added support for performing late
	binding operations in System.Object derived objects.

	<p>Status 6981 successful tests out of 7229 from Mozilla's
	test suite.

<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<p>Completed ViewState MAC, a cryptographic checksum to
	prevent tampering with the view state.

	<p>Input/output filtering works again.

	<p>Many bug fixes and performance improvements are available
	in this version thanks to Gonzalo.

<h3>LDAP</h3>

	<ul>	
		<li>Changes in Connection.cs regarding appropriate handling
		in method ServerCertificateValidation.
		
		<li> Added support for error code 113 SSL_HANDSHAKE_FAILED. 
	
		<li>Added two files ResultCodeMessages.txt and
		ExceptionMessages.txt in Novell.Directory.Ldap.Utilclass
	
		<li>Added support for subordinate subtree scope. 
		<li>Removed hard coded dependency on Mono Security 
		<li>Fix for a race condition in Connection.cs
		
		<li>Updated with support for Interactiveness of SSL Handshake,
		Ldap Events, Edir Events, Intermediate Response
		
		<li>Connection.cs class is modified by synchronizing the
		stream threads so as to avoid the memory consumption and
		handle consumption.
		
		<li>Changed version from 2.1.1 to 2.1.4 in Connection.cs.
		
		<li>Updated ChangeLog so that latest changes are on the top.
	</ul>

<h3>Mono.Posix assembly</h3>

 	<p>Filenames exported from Mono.Unix and Mono.Unix.Native may
	be in a special UnixEncoding format so that arbitrary
	filenames may be accessed (i.e. filenames outside of UTF-8 or
	the MONO_EXTERNAL_ENCODINGS value).  See the post <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2005-October/015422.html">"Mono.Unix
	Filename Marshalling"</a>

	<p>The Mono.Unix namespace is being reorganized for easier
	maintenance, easier documentation, and CLS compliance.  The
	low-level Syscall and Stdlib and related types will move into
	the Mono.Unix.Native namespace.  The UnixConvert,
	UnixDirectory, UnixFile, UnixGroup, and UnixUser classes are
	obsolete and will be removed in a future release.  The types
	of existing members will change in the next release.

	<p>This release is still 100% compatible with previous
	releases.  Impacted members have been marked [Obsolete] with messages
	to indicate the replacement method.  The next release will be an API
	break (changing the return type of effected properties & methods), and
	obsolete types will be removed in the following release.

	<p>Mono.Unix is targeting API stability for 1.2.  If you have any
	suggestions for improvement, I would love to hear them.

	<p>See also: <a
	href="http://www.jprl.com/Blog/archive/mono/2005/Sep-20.html">"Mono.Unix
	Reorganization"</a> and <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2005-October/015441.html">"Mono.Unix
	Future Directions, Questions"</a>

<h3>MonoDoc</h3>

	<p>Rafael contributed a hierarchical storage for bookmarks to
	the Monodoc GUI browser.

	<p>GtkHTML# is now an optional dependency as well as
	GeckoSharp. 

<h3>Relocatable</h3>

	<p>Mono is now relocatable.  This means that a Mono package or
	RPM can be relocated to any directory and will continue to
	work.  This works on Linux systems and Solaris 10.

	<p><b>Important:</b> If you embed Mono, you must now call the
	can call instead mono_assembly_setrootdir($libdir) and
	mono_set_config_dir ($sysconfdir) to set the library directory
	and the system configuration directories.

<h3>Cairo bindings</h3>

	<p>Idan contributed some large changes to Mono.Cairo to polish
	the API:

	<p>Matrix:

	<ul>
		<li>Removed Matrix_T struct and associated properties,

		<li>Added ==, != operators

		<li>Implemented ICloneable

		<li>Overrode Equals, GetHashcode, ToString

		<li>Made constructors a little simpler, New matrices
		are constructed as the identity matrix.

		<li>Added IsIdentity

		<li>Fiddled a bit with Multiply, now there is void
		Multiply (Matrix b) -- multiplies this matrix by b
		static Matrix Multiply (Matrix a, Matrix b) --
		multiplies a by b and returns the result.
		
		<li> Threw out all references to "Identify", it's the "Identity".

	</ul>

	<p>CairoAPI: fix out/ref issues (it was previously segfaulting).

	<p>Graphics:
	<ul>

		<li>convert [Inverse]Transform(Point/Distance)
		properties to methods so you can transform arbitrary
		points/distances.

		<li>Added Transform (Matrix m)
		
		<li>Fixed Matrix {get; set;} to use updated CairoAPI.
		
		<li>Fixed FontSetMatrix (this should be made into a
		property for consistency)
		
	</ul>

<h3>C# compiler</h3>

	<p>The default encoding for the compiler has changed from the
	hardcoded ISO-28591 to be the default encoding used in your
	system.  This will help developers compile code that was
	written in the editor they are using.
	
	<p>The last two features of C# 2.0 have been completed by
	Carlos Alberto: Friend Assemblies and External Alias
	qualifiers.

	<p>We are only missing the late semantics changes that were
	introduced for nullable types and boxing in C# for a fully
	compatible implementation.
	
<h3>.NET 2.x updates</h3>

	<p>Chris Toshok continues to work on the System.Configuration
	framework for ASP.NET 2.x on which many of the new features
	are built.

	<p>Roozbeh Pournader contributed a PersianCalendar
	implementation.  Roozbeh described the Persian calendar to
	Microsoft originally so we have a very good implementation.

	<p>Our Calendars now support half of the new 2.x features.

	<p>Atsushi updated parts of System.XML method signatures to
	match RTM.

<h3>Various Changes</h3>

	<p>Support for contravariant and covariant delegates in the
	System.Delegate class for 2.x operations.

	<p>Updated ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib to the latest version.

	<p>Runtime will no longer turn segfaults in unmanaged code
	into a NullReferenceException.  Now faults in unmanaged code
	will abort the program execution and display the stack trace
	(managed/unmanaged).  This was useful to uncover a number of
	real bugs in a few applications and some of our own libraries.

<h3>Performance, Memory Usage</h3>

	<p>Our quest to reduce memory consumption continues.  Thanks
	to Jon Trowbridge for implementing a new heap profiler (the
	heap-buddy module on SVN) which has helped tremendously in
	identifying the fat in the class libraries and spots for easy
	optimization.  

	<p>Some areas that received attention: StreamReader.ReadLine
	is much more efficient memory-wise.

	<p>Zoltan implemented a feature to track the page access to
	the executable images.  Which was used by Zoltan and Ben to
	reduce the number of page faults required to run an
	application (AOT and regular uses).  Paolo reduced the amount
	of memory used by our internal data structures. 
	
	<p>In this release region-locking of files has been turned off
	by default which will improve IO for some applications, it can
	be turned on by setting the MONO_STRICT_IO_EMULATION variable.

	<p>A new profiler: `mono-profiler-aot' has been created that
	tracks the usage patterns for executables.  The output of this
	profile can be fed back into Mono's AOT compiler to order the
	functions on the disk to produce precompiled images that have
	methods in sequential pages.

	<p>Zoltan implemented frame pointer elimination on x86-64
	platforms.

	<p>Patrik Torstensson and Zoltan improved the performance of
	methods with exception clauses when the exception object is
	not used (Bug #62150).

	<p>Patrik ported the mul_imm optimizations from the old JIT
	engine to mini.

	<p>Ben optimized DateTime parsing.

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.10</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.10 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.10

	<p><b>Source Code and Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Source code and pre-compiled packages for SUSE, SLES,
	Fedora Core 3, 4, RHEL, MacOS and Windows in a variety of
	platforms available from our web site from the <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">download</a>
	section.

	</blockquote>

	<p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>
        
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	 source code is very simple.
	
	 <p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-1.1.10.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-1.1.10
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

</pre>

	<p>Then compile libgdiplus:
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf libgdiplus-1.1.10.tar.gz
    $ cd libgdiplus-1.1.10
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

</pre>
