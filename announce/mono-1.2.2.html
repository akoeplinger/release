	<p>Mono 1.2.2 is an update to <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.1">Mono 1.2.1</a> in

	series</a>, it is a bug fix release for all the supported
	components, but also includes updates on the 2.0 stack.

<h3>Mono Migration Assistant</h3>

	<p>Jonathan Pobst released the <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moma">Mono Migration
	Analysis</a> tool as part of the Mono 1.2 launch, and we were
	able to get a tremendous amount of feedback on what features
	people depended on.

	<p>Both features that were known to have limitations in Mono
	(they are called "MonoTODOs") as well as APIs that we have not
	yet implemented.

	<p>Some early results from the submissions we have received
	are <a
	href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Nov-28.html">here</a>
	and <a
	href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Nov-28-1.html">here</a>.

	<p>This release addresses many of the issues that were
	reported: implementation of many APIs that developers needed,
	removal of incorrect MonoTODOs that we had accumulated over
	the years and clarifications to many of the MonoTODOs to
	actually describe the limitations found.

	<p>Specifically, this release:
	<ul>
		<li>496 new methods implemented.
		<li>212 removed bogus TODOs.
		<li>65 removed NotImplementExceptions.
	</ul>

<h1>New in Mono 1.2.2</h1>
	
	<p>This release contains many bug fixes to the C# compiler,
	Windows.Forms and ASP.NET.   Developers and users are
	encouraged to upgrade to this release.

	<p>This release also includes a critical fixe to the runtime
	startup.  Heavily multi-threaded applications would have
	crashed otherwise.

<h3>New Moma</h3>

	<p>A new version of Moma, available with this release has been
	prepared: it has been updated to use the 1.2.2 API, contains
	an updating mechanism (so we can update the APIs without
	releasing new Momas) and we optionally allow developers to
	enter information that you want to send to the Mono team
	[Jonathan Pobst].
	
<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>Jonathan Pobst implemented many new classes from
	Windows.Forms 2.x.  Mono now supports ContextMenuStrips,
	ToolStripContainers, ToolStripDropDownButtons,
	ToolStripManager, and ToolStripSplitButtons.

	<p>Many updates and bug fixes, specially to MDI code.

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>We found another series of problems with anonymous
	methods.   Martin fixed all the known problems.

	<p>We <b>strongly</b> encourage developers to upgrade to this
	version of Mono and the C# compiler as the code generated
	between 1.1.18 and 1.2.1 would not have the proper activation
	semantics for variables captured by anonymous methods [Martin
	Baulig].

	<p>In addition, the merging of the MCS and GMCS compilers
	continued.   The tokenizer is now shared, which only leaves
	the parser and the generics support as a difference between
	the two compilers [Marek Safar].

<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<P>We continue to improve the ASP.NET 2.x implementation.

	<p>Support for registering controls from within
	Web.config (if that went into the release), several improvements to
	handling of App_Code and fixed support for <configSections> in
	Web.config [Marek]

	
<h3>GDI+</h3>

	<p>Our internal cairo implementation has been upgraded to
	version 1.2.6.

<h3>Security</h3>

        Improvements to 2.0 classes dealing with X.509 certificates [Sebastien].

<h3>Tools</h3>

	<p>mkbundle now can generate code that can be embedded into an
	application (in addition to generating standalone
	applications) [Joshua Tauberer].

<h3>Console</h3>

	<p>Under the 2.0 profile, we now do lazy initialization of the
	Console, so the new code is only activated if the user
	actually needs some of the new features, reducing memory
	consumption, but also keeping the semantics of 2.0 compiled
	applications inline with Unix unless new features are
	requested (Gonzalo).
	
<h3>Visual Basic</h3>

	<p>Many improvements and bug fixes to the VB runtime, and it
	is now running IBuySpy, DevZone (Based on DotNetNuke)

	<p>The ASP.NET sites were tested with Grasshopper, as Mono
	does not yet have a complete VB compiler available to compile
	Visual Basic applications on the server.
