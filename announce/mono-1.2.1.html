<h3>Core</h3>

<h3>MIPS Port</h3>

	working version developers need to use SVN releases [Mark
	Mason].


<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>Many bug fixes to Windows.Forms from the Winforms team,
	all the blocking bugs have been eliminated:

	<ol>

	    <li>RichTextBox/TextBox received a lot of usability fixes,
	    improved support for wrapping, performance enhancements
	    and no longer crashes with long documents.

	    <li>We pass all our unit tests on linux now (all 598 of
	    them).
	    
	   <li>Transparent/translucent windows really work with Xgl +
	   Compiz.
	
	   <li>Startup performance improvements for X11 (use
          XInternAtoms instead of many XInternAtom calls).
	
	   <li>Many more focus fixes.
	   
	   <li>Many, many TextBox/RichTextBox fixes.
	   <li>NotifyIcon fixes (should work fine on linux now).
	   
	   <li>Popup windows (and menus) no longer steal focus from
	   the main form on win32.
	   
	   <li>Fixed win32 bug which resulted in non-visible controls
	   actually showing up at (0,0).
	   
	   <li>TreeView got its scrolling  improved, expands and
	   collapses without rendering glitches and rendering with
	   ImageLists is fixed. 
	   
	   <li>Datagrid fixes for handling DataSet binding/navigation.
	   
	   <li>X11 deadlock/hang/crash fixes for MT apps.
	   
	   <li>Printing UI is nicer (doesn't crash with unhandled
	   exceptions) when you have no printers installed/configured.
	   
	   <li>Many toolbar/menu fixes.

	   <li>System colors will keep their names, and track the Gtk
	   names.

<h3>ComponentModel</h3>

	<p>Support for more type converters (arrays of strings were
	not previously supported), Sebastien.

<h3>ADO.NET</h3>

	<p>2.0 updates, XmlSchema reading and writing (Nagappan).

<h3>Process</h3>

	<p>The Process launching will now support opening special
	files in addition to launching programs.  On FreeDesktop
	systems it will use xdg-open, if not, it will try to use
	gnome-open or kfmclient to open the files.

	<p>This means that Process.Start ("file.pdf") will open your
	PDF viewer, and Process.Start ("http://www.gnome.org") will
	launch your web browser to load that url.
