<h1>Mono 0.28 Release</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>

	<p>A new release of the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> runtime and SDK is
	available for UNIX and Windows.  Packages for various
	distributions are also available from our download page.</p>

	<p>Since the last release, 1,124 individual commits were done to
	our runtime and class libraries.</p>

	<p>144 bugzilla bugs were closed.</p>

	<p>I know that the following summary is incomplete, I
	apologize for missing major features</p>

	<p>We have finished the SourceGear <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=sourcegear">contract</a>,
	which funded Web Services in Mono as well as various
	improvements in the runtime.  We are very happy to have served
	our first customer, and we will continue to improve Mono to
	make sure the <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">Vault
	software</a> runs flawlessly on Mono.

	<p>As you can expect, this release features bug fixes
	everywhere: memory leaks plugged, performance problems solved,
	performance improvements and more.  A special area of
	robustness is the client-side web services component: it is
	extremely robust now, as one of the SourceGear acceptance
	criteria was a 24-hour continuous test of their client library
	that did millions of web service operations.

	<p>We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server
	side component in the next release, the www.go-mono.com site
	<a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.html">documentation</a>
	is currently running with Mono and our ASP.NET implementation
	(that is why the site has gone down a few times: we were using
	it on our production system to use it under stress).

	<p>Each new release of Mono opens the door for more abusive
	tests, and this time is not an exception, we already have a
	few areas of performance and scalability that we want to
	address for the next release.

<h2>1. Availability</h2>
	
	<p>Binaries for various platforms are available from our web
        site from the <a

<h2>2. New Features in this release.</h2>

<h3>New Thread Locking</h3>

	<p>Zoltan removed the big locks we had in the runtime, and now
	we have a finely grained lock system in the runtime.  Runtime
	hackers can read the included lock matrix document which
	describes the requirements to use the new fine grained locks
	in their code.

<h3>Ahead of Time Compiler Optimizations</h3>

	<p>Zoltan has worked extensively on the Mono ahead-of-time
	compilation feature (AOT).  The AOT code is now considered to
	be production quality, and also for the first time
	precompiled code runs faster than JITed code.  This resulted
	in a 13% compilation speed up for the Mono C# compiler,
	reducing the compile time to 3.185 seconds.  A clear goal of
	the team for the next release is to reach 3.1416 seconds.

	<p>An MCS bug prevents System.dll from being precompiled
	currently, we hope to fix this by the next release, but
	everything else should work fine. 

<h3>Web Services</h3>

	<p>Now we have a complete Web Services stack in Mono, In this
	release we added:

	<ul>
		<li>The WSDL command line tool: this tool is used to
		generate web service client proxies from a WSDL
		document (local or remote).
		
		<li>WSDL documents: now ASP.NET can generate a WSDL
		document for any web service that it hosts.

		<li>Web service documentation page: it shows
		information about the methods of a web service. It
		also provides a form with which you can test simple
		methods.

		<li>Support for HttpGet and HttpPost protocols.

		<li>Our WSDL documentation page (http://.../file.asmx)
		also can generate a sample proxy for you, if you don't
		want to use wsdl.  
	</ul>

	<p>Notice that the stack was already functional in 0.26, but
	the addition of the WSDL tools makes the setup complete for
	developing completely on Mono.

	<p>The work to support Web Services was possible thanks to <a
	href="http://www.sourcegear.com">SourceGear</a>.  We should
	all send them a token of appreciation.

<h3>Xml Serialization</h3>

	<p>New XML serializer generator tool (genxs). With this tool
	you can generate a XML serializer for any type and customize
	it to your needs.  For details about the use of this tool see
	Lluis' blog: <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html">http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html</a>

	<p>Lots of fixes and improvements to support the WSDL
	generation and consumption.

<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>Sebastien has implemented Authenticode(tm) and the code is
	now part of the distribution.

	<p>A couple of new tools are available: signcode and
	chktrust.  The former is used to sign assemblies (or any PE
	files) and the later is used to verify signatures and
	timestamps.

<h3>Web Service Enhancements</h3>

	<p>Implementations of WSE 1.0 and WSE 2.0 appeared on the CVS,
	thanks to Sebastien, Duncan, Todd and Daniel.   We build both
	assemblies at this point.

<h3>XML Improvements</h3>

	<p>Speed and memory usage: extensive use of --profile and
	various clever tricks from Atsushi and Ben.  Lots of
	performance critical classes were improved, and XPathDocument
	(which is used extensively by XPath and Xslt) uses arrays of
	structs for its implementation to improve performance.

	<p>XML Schema validation support in now in XmlValidatingReader
	(although it is not finished). It also means that now many schema component
	constraints have been implemented.

<h3>Remoting</h3>

	<p>Added support for CallContext. Now the CallContext is sent through
	remoting boundaries and fixed various problems related to
	in/out parameters in Remoting invocations.

	<p>Improved robustness, specially for asynchronous calls.

<h3>Generics</h3>

	<p>Work continues on supporting generics: more changes have
	been done to the runtime, class libraries and tools, but we
	are not complete.  

	<p>To build the generic version of Mono, you have to compile
	the code from source, and build the class libraries with the
	`generics' profile (make PROFILE=generics).  The generics C#
	compiler is called `gmcs' and not `mcs'.  They will merge in
	the future, but we wanted to maintain mcs robust, and do all
	of our experimentation on a separate branch. 

<h3>XSLT Managed Engine</h3>

	<p>Over the past month, Ben's Managed XSLT engine has grown by
	leaps and bounds. The implementation now offers compliance in
	critical areas such as template conflict resolution. It also
	implements all of the XSLT elements, including xsl:number. All
	of the extension functions with the exception of format-number
	have also been implemented.

	<p>Oleg Tkachenko, a seasoned .NET developer, joined Ben in
	his efforts on XSLT, working on making the design of
	outputting XSLT much better. His work will allow for better
	compliance with the spec, greatly improved speed, and support
	for mode="html" for xsl:output.

	<p>The work of all the XSLT hackers has resulted in a major rewarded, in
	many cases the managed engine is faster than the C based libxslt.

	<p>Although the Managed XSLT provider is still not the default
	provider, you can enable it by setting the MONO_MANAGED_XSLT
	environment variable, like this:

<blockquote><pre>
	export MONO_MANAGED_XSLT=true</pre></blockquote>

<h3>PowerPC Runtime</h3>

	<p>Progress on the PowerPC JIT engine, but the full engine did
	not make it into the 0.28 release, it should still be
	available before the Microsoft PDC.
	
<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>We got a nice upgrade from Vladimir at <a
	href="http://www.openlinksw.com">OpenLink</a> for WineLib:
	various new DLLs from the Wine runtime are now available (in
	particular all the common dialog routines are now available to
	us).  Vladimir is currently working on updating WineLib to the
	latest edition of Wine.
	
	<p>Jordi Mas contributed the ListViewItem widget and the file
	dialog and Jonathan Hogg contributed a few fixes to the code
	base as well.  Brian Takita contributed the List control.

	<p>Alexandre Pigolkine continued fixing the various low-level
	controls to have the same rendering behavior that they do have
	on Windows together with Jerome Laban.  We started a thread to
	discuss the future implementation strategy for System.Drawing
	to be fully cross-platform.

	<p>Dennis continues in his quest to fix all the signatures in
	the Windows.Forms.  Johannes added support to make Wine track
	the theme settings of Gnome (we will fully complete this on
	the next release).

	<p>System.Drawing now has migrated to use Cairo bindings on
	Unix.

<h3>IL Assembler</h3>

	<p>Jackson was in charge of most of these improvements.  New
	features in this release: .data, p/invoke support, allow
	multiple constraints on generic parameters, Oberon is now self
	hosting with our il assembler and plenty of bugs fixed.

<h3>JScript and Vsa</h3>

	<p>Cesar has picked up again on JScript and has done
	incredible progress on JScript and the Vsa engine, still not
	ready for hello world, but moving along. 
	
<h3>Bug Fixing</h3>

	<p>As you can expect bug fixes everywhere: ASP.NET server and
	client, ADO.NET, memory leak fixes.  The client side for web
	services is extremely robust (we passed the 24-hour continuous
	test from SourceGear and fixed tons of memory leaks,
	performance issues and stability problems).

	<p>We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server
	side component
