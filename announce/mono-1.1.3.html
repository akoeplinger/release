<h1>Mono 1.1.3 Development Release</h1>


	<p>Mono 1.1.3 is the third release on the development series
	of Mono and it is not intended to be used for production as it
	is undergoing internal changes.  Those interested in a
	stable release should use the Mono 1.0.xx series.

	<p>The Mono 1.1.xx series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

<h2>Changes since the last release</h2>

	<p>The following is a high-level description of the changes in
	the development release of Mono since the previous development
	release in October 29nd.

	<p>There have been plenty of bug fixes: 63 on the core
	runtime, 235 in all the components of Mono.

	<p>Although this a development version, this release contains
	mostly bug fixes, speedups and tuning in every subsystem of
	Mono. In addition to that, some key new changes are:

<h3>New Build System</h3>

	<p>Hari has completed the new build system for Mono, you will
	notice that a single tarball is now shipped that contains the
	source code for the Mono C runtime and the Mono C# libraries.
	We finally have a single `make' command to build the entire
	Mono source code.

	<p>The new unified system allows distributors to easily apply
	patches to the C# code base, something that before was hard to
	do.

	<p>.exe files that were installed into $prefix/bin are
	now gone into a different place. 

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

	<p>Massimiliano completed the work on the SSA-based partial
	redundancy elimination (SSAPRE).

	<p>SSAPRE is an optimization that performs Common
	Subexpression Elimination (CSE), loop invariant code motion
	and elimination of other redundancies in a unified way.

	<p>Needless to say, this gives very nice speed improvements.
	To turn this on, you must use the <tt>-O=ssapre</tt> flag when
	running Mono or pre-compiling your applications with AOT.

	<p>The AMD64 branch has a prototype of our code-sharing code
	generator by Zoltan, when this matures we will investigate
	bringing this to every other platform.

	<p>Lluis improved the remoting performance for the cross
	application domain channel.  Calls across application domains
	are now faster (up to 10 times in some cases).

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>Our generics compiler implementation has reached beta
	status: it is now feature complete and will compile and run
	the entire <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/">C5</a>
	regression test suite (Martin).

	<p>Documentation: the compiler now supports the -doc: command
	line option to extract inline documentation into XML documents
	(Atsushi).

	<p>C# 2.0: Support for covariance and contravariance in
	delegates(Carlos Alberto).

	<p>C# 2.0: Support for property accessor accessibility (Carlos
	Alberto).

	<p>Parser verbosity on errors has been reduced.

	<p>Plenty of bug fixing, as well as reportinjg new errors and
	warnings reported (Atsushi, Ben, Hari, Marek, Martin, Miguel).

<h3>Summary of C# 2.0 features supported</h3>
	
	<p>Today Mono 1.1.3's C# compiler supports <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0yw3tz5k.aspx">anonymous
	methods</a>, <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/dscyy5s0.aspx">iterators</a>,
	<a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/wa80x488.aspx">partial
	classes</a>, <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/79b3xss3.aspx">static
	classes</a>,
	<a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/sea07341.aspx">covariance
	and contravariance</a>,
	<a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/75e8y5dd.aspx">property
	accessor accessibility</a> 
	 and <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/441722ys.aspx">inline
	warning control</a> from the 2.0 specification.  <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/512aeb7t.aspx">Generics</a>
	are supported as well on the branched `gmcs' compiler
	(included).

	<p>Still missing for full 2.0 support: nullable types,
	namespace alias qualifier, external assembly alias, fixed size
	buffers and friend assemblies.

<h3>Bundles</h3>

	<p>Bundles are a mechanism to bundle in a single binary the
	Mono runtime, its dependencies and your application to produce
	a standalone application.
	
	<p>Creating bundles with Mono 1.1.3 is a lot simpler than it
	was in the past, we have now introduced the `mkbundle' program
	that will assist developers in creating self-contained
	applications built with Mono.

	<p>See the <tt>mkbundle(1)</tt> man page for details.

<h3>Mono.Posix</h3>

	<p>Jonathan Pryor lead the development of a new namespace
        which rationalizes the old Mono.Posix namespace, and also adds
        integration classes between the Posix world and the .NET world
        (the old libraries merely exposed the syscall interface).

	<p>The new namespace is called Mono.Unix namespace, and it
        contains the new Syscall class which exports 64-bit APIs.
        This should now be portable across 32-bit and 64-bit
        platforms.

	<p>Added higher-level wrapper classes, all prefixed with Unix, to
          present a .NET-like API over the Syscall functionality.
	  
        <p>The existing Mono.Posix namespace should be considered
        deprecated (or at least unmaintained), in preference to the
        Mono.Unix namespace.

<h3>JScript</h3>

	<p>Cesar continues work on Javascript, the focus has now been
	on the runtime, executing the applications that the JavaScript
	compiler has produced.

<h3>ASP.NET 2.0</h3>

	<p>Lluis implemented the System.Configuration namespace from
	ASP.NET.

	<p>Lluis implemented the TreeView control.

	<p>Lluis added support for client callbacks.

<h3>S390, PowerPC</h3>

	<p>Supports Varargs now (Neale, Geoff).

	<p>All tests for generics and non-generics pass on the S390,
	PowerPC (Neale, Geoff).

<h3>System.XML</h3>

	<p>Atsushi did some fixes to the DataSet class generator.
	
	<p>Xml performance improvements: XmlTextReader got couple of fixes
	each of them improves 5-15% for various scenario.

	<p>XPathNavigator over XmlDocument got significant memory cost
	reduction, and we also reduced some extraneous clone cost in
	XPath iterators (Atsushi).
  
	<p>System.XML 2.0 implementation: XmlSchemaInference.  Entity
	resolution support on XmlTextReader.

<h3>RelaxNG support</h3>

	<p>From Atsushi; Performance improvements and
	bugfixes.

	<p>Experimental element/attribute name collector API.
	
<h3>Postgres provider: Npgsql</h3>

	<p>Large Object support: Npgsql now supports large object
	operations. Thanks Emiliano Necciari (e dot necciari at blogic
	dot it) for the patch!

	<p>Added support for ParameterDirection.Output and
	ParameterDirection.InputOutput parameters. Now you can use
	these types of parameters to get results. Thanks Ivan
	(ivan-sun1 at mail dot ru) and (teste at aslls dot ss) for
	heads up.

	<p>Plus many new bug fixes.
	
<h3>Windows.Forms and System.Drawing</h3>

	<p>Work on the new managed implementation of Windows.Forms
	continues, we hope that by the next release the new implementation
	completely replaces the existing version during the build
	process.

	<p>There are many new controls and a native driver to the
	MacOSX is in progress.  New controls: tab container, treeview,
	listview, listbox, menus, popups, tooltips, NumericUpDown.

	<p>Although there is a lot of progress in this area, Windows.Forms
	is not yet ready for most people testing it.

	<p>Folks interested in helping with the implementation might want
	to go to the #mono-winforms channel on the irc network at
	irc.gnome.org.

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.3</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.3 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.3

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE 9, SUSE 9.1, Red Hat 9, SLES
        8, Fedora Core 1, Fedora Core 2 and MacOS X are available from
	our web site from the
        <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">download</a>
        section.  A Red Carpet Mono channel is also available on these
        platforms.

	<blockquote>
	 <p><b>icu 2.6.1 or later</b> Optional: for supporting string collation.
	 <p><b>Cairo 0.1.23</b> Required to install libgdiplus.
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>
        
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	 source code is very simple.
	
	 <p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-1.1.3.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-1.1.3
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
	
</pre>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Optional Packages</b><p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Libgdiplus is an optional packages, you only need
	those if you intent to use System.Drawing or Windows.Forms.
	
	<p>libgdiplus:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf libgdiplus-1.1.3.tar.gz
    $ cd libgdiplus-1.1.3
    $ ./configure
    $ make install
	
</pre>
