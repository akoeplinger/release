<h1>Mono 1.1.16 Release</h1>

	<p>This is the third beta towards the release of Mono 1.2.   
	
	<p>Mono was branched at version 1.1.13 to become the stable
	version of Mono that is distributed by Novell on its
	enterprise products.   That series of releases are only
	getting bug fixes.

	<p>Before each release we run all of the regression tests on
	Mono, so we consider this release usable for deployment, but
	there are still a few changes in various areas.  
	
	<p>All of the changes since 1.0 are documented in the
	following release notes: <a

<h1>Changes since Mono 1.1.15</h1>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

	<p><a
	href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython
	1.0 Beta 8</a> works with this release out of the box.

	<p>Majorly improved Windows.Forms and System.Drawing as our
	beta program for Windows.Forms continues.

	<p>New default optimizations boost performance for compute
	intensive applications.

	<p>Long standing debugging line numbers bug fixed.

	<p>Preview code for the new Compacting GC.

	<p>Hardened runtime for verification, AppDomain unloading and
	type loading failures

	<p>Significant progress on ASP.NET 2.0, some <a
	href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/starterkits/default.aspx?tabid=62#personal">Starter
	Kits</a> are now functional, as well as large improvements to
	its test suite.
	
<h2>Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>Windows.Forms continues to be a focus of bug fixing in this
	release.  

	<p>Multi-thread support for Windows.Forms: In the past our
	Windows.Forms implementation behaved like most other toolkits
	in Unix.  It was not a multi-threaded toolkit.   With this
	released Windows.Forms has become multi-threaded (multi-thread
	considerations still apply), but multiple threads can create
	their own forms and controls and have their own separate
	message processing loops.

	<p>Repaint logic changed: Instead of having paint events that
	are contained in the queue and make their way to the head of the
	queue, we now only generate synthetic paint events for dirty windows
	once the queue is emtpy. This matches MS behaviour and allows for a
	more responsive UI if lots of activity (or slow drawing) happens.

	<p>MDI support has been improved extensively by Jackson.

	<p>DataGrid support has been improved extensively by Chris and
	is much more usable now.
	
	<p>Many performance improvements went into the tree control.

<h2>System.Drawing</h2>

	<p>Sebastien implemented the GraphicsPath.AddPathString
	methods which add the outlines of a string into the path.

	<p>Bill Holmes and Sebastien teamed up to fix many of the
	LinearGradient brush bugs.

	<p>Peter and Gonzalo reimplemented the image infrastructure to
	fix several bugs. 

	<p>Property reading for PNG files is now supported.

	<p>Sebastien: BeginContainer support
	
	<p>Sebastien: Region handles (GdipGetRegionHRgn,
	GdipCreateRegionHrgn and GdipSetClipHrgn).

	<p>Sebastien: Added support for point visibility on paths,
	GdipIsOutlineVisiblePathPoint[I] and GdipIsVisiblePathPoint[I]
	functions are now implemented;

<h2>Runtime</h2>

	<p>Stack traces line numbers fixed.   In the past, stack
	traces pointed to the next statement, which typically
	translated into line offsets being "off by one", in reality
	they were off by a statement, which confused developers.   The
	line information is now correctly reported.

	<p>Paolo's new Generational GC has been integrated into Mono,
	but it is not currently supported.  Documentation is available
	in <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Compacting_GC">http://www.mono-project.com/Compacting_GC</a>
	and docs/precise-gc.

	<p>The compacting GC currently only works on the 1.0 profile
	of Mono, the 2.0 support has not been modified yet to work
	with it, so full Mono bootstraps will fail with it.

	<p>Zoltan fixed many leaks and bugs related to unloading
	assemblies.  Also, this version of the runtime is friendlier
	to shutting down Mono (for hosting users, this was driven by
	<a href="http://www.otee.dk">Otee's</a> Unity needs).

	<p>Verification and reliability work: work has resumed on
	implementing verification on Mono, as some users (<a
	href="http://secondlife.com/">SecondLife</a> in particular)
	need this feature.  In addition to the verification work, we
	have started to strengthen the runtime to cope with missing or
	broken referenced assemblies.  All known filed bugs that made
	the runtime crash will now produce a TypeLoadException.
	
	<P>Jonathan Chambers has contributed some initial bits for COM
	support in Mono.  This includes BSTR and VARIANT marshalling
	on Windows.

	<p>IronPython beta 8 works out of the box.  IronPython
	on each release has been adding dependencies into new .NET 2.0
	features that were not yet implemented in Mono, hence the need
	to update our support as they move along.

	<p>Sebastien added support for .NET 2.0 declarative security
	to the runtime.

<h2>Performance</h2>

	<p>Massi enabled the inline optimization by default, which
	improves performance in many conditions.  To enable inlining,
	it was necessary to tune a number of other optimizations
	(constant propagation, dead code elimination).

	<p>The improvements give 6% boost in XmlMark, 3% on SciMark,
	15% on the particle benchmark, 1.85% on mcs bootstrap, on x86
	systems.

	<p>On x86-64, it produces 6% boost on XmlMark, 0.4% on
	SciMark, 19.5% on particle benchmark, and 2.6% on mcs
	bootstrap.

	<p>Full optimizations and SSA optimizations are also very
	good, but the individual optimizations have not been tuned to
	work with each other.  More detailed information created by
	Massi about the new improvements are available <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/Benckmarks-2006-03-23.ods">here</a>.

<h2>ASP.NET 2.0</h2>

	<p>The Mainsoft team (Vladimir Krasnov, Andrew Skiba, and
	Konstantin Triger) has contributed many updates to the ASP.NET
	2.0 support and it is now able to run the <a
	href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/starterkits/default.aspx?tabid=62#personal">ASP.NEt
	Personal Web Site Starter Kit</a>.

	<p>Most of the bugs were in the theme and skin support.

<h2>ASP.NET 2.0 Test Suite</h2>

	<p>The testing team at Mainsoft (Yoni Klain, Tal Klar, Andrew
	Skiba, and Merav Soudri) has enhanced the System.Web NUnit
	test suite:

	<ul>
	
		<li>A testing framework package that provides Web
		Hosting capabilities, which enables testing the entire
		System.Web functionalities, including post backs,
		context related features (Master Page, Themes and
		Skins) and more.

		<li>An HTML Compare package that performs an advanced
		HTML comparing, by transferring HTML into XML and
		compares the XML. (An "ignore" tags/ attributes
		mechanism is also supported).

		<li>Developed 23 new test fixtures (~220 tests) for
		System.Web 2.0 using the above framework, testing 23
		System.Web.UI.WebControls classes. Work on this path
		continues towards full coverage of System.Web 2.0.
	</ul>

<h2>C# Compiler Bug Fixes</h2>

	<p>Marek implemented Type forwarding (see bug 77002) in the
	compiler.

	<p>Harinath implemented several important changes in the
	compiler:
	
	<p>Several bugs in handling 'lvalue' accesses have been fixed.
	In particular, we propagate 'lvalue' lookups of value-type
	fields to their surrounding objects, allowing better detection
	of access to read-only fields and MarshalByRef objects.
	
	<p>The flow-analysis code in the compiler has been overhauled.
	This fixes several bugs related to handling of 'goto's,
	unreachable code, and warnings about undefined variables.  We
	also fixed the code generator to emit the 'leave' instruction
	rather than 'br' when jumping out of an unwind-protected
	region (try { ... } finally { ... }, lock { ... }, using {
	... }, etc.)
	
	<p>The code for numeric promotions has been rewritten to align
	more closely with the standard.  In particular, we now follow
	the "overloading" specification used in the standard: the
	original code implemented a non-normative (informative)
	section of the standard which provided an intuitive
	explanation of the semantics.  This rewrite now allows
	expressions involving user-defined conversions to numeric
	types.

	<p>Martin implemented support for switch on nullable types, a
	feature that did not make it in time to the C# standard but is
	available in the Microsoft compiler and the annotated C#
	standard. 
	
<h2>2.0 Features</h2>

	<p>Many updates from Atsushi to the 2.0 profile.
	
<h2>S390 and S390x Port</h2>

	<p>Neale fixed a critical bug in the S390 and S390x port, the
	atomic interlock operations are now functional on this
	architecture.

<h2>OSX support</h2>

	<p>Mach port leaks identified by Imeem are now fixed, patch
	from Allan. 
	
	<p>Packages for Mono on OSX/Intel are now available.

<h2>IO Layer</h2>

	<p>Dick fixed a complex problem dealing with resource
	starvation problem with thread handles (78241).

	<p>GetCurrentThread now matches MS behavior.
	
<h2>Debugger</h2>

	<p>Lots of work from Martin in the debugger, the major
	features are:

	<ul>
		<li>Breakpoints are saved across runs of a program.

		<li>Many bug fixes, and it is now possible to debug
		xsp and Winforms applications (no full ASP.NET yet).
	</ul>
	
<h2>XBuild</h2>

	<p>A major breakthrough in this release from Marek: XBuild is
	able to build some Visual Studio.NET 2005 projects (that don't
	contain references to assemblies not in GAC nor use
	resources).

	<p>In addition,  there is now support for simple conditions in
	xbuild. 

<h2>Tools</h2>

	<p>monodis and ilasm now support the 2.0 declarative security
	attributes (Sebastien and Ankit).

	<p>Ankit also updated ilasm to support custom attributes on
	assemblies, return types of methods and custom modifiers.

	<p>mono-find-requires and mono-find-provides will now only
	list GAC dependencies.   In the past they listed all
	dependencies, which meant that there were implicit
	dependencies on private assemblies.

<h2>NUnit</h2>

	<p>NUnit Mocks framework has been integrated into the standard
	Mono distribution.

<h2>CAS Tests</h2>

	<P>This is the first release to enable the CAS tests during
	the build process.
	
<h2>Cairo</h2>

	<p>The Mono.Cairo library has been updated to the 1.2 Cairo
	API (John Luke).
	
<h2>Coverity and Bug Fixing</h2>

	<p>In this release we have included a number of bug fixes that
	were uncovered by the <a
	href="http://www.coverity.com">Coverity</a> source code
	scanning tool.   Thanks to Coverity for including Mono on
	their stack of open source applications that they scan.
