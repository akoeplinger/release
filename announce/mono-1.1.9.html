<h3>New Ports</h3>

	<p>Zoltan completed the IA64 (Itanium) port of Mono.  The
	Itanium port is a full 64 bit port of the Mono JIT compiler. 
	
	<p>Paolo completed the ARM port of Mono, it works on little
	endian and big endian ARM systems.

	<p>Dick added support for 64 bit thread ids to the io-layer.
	
	<p>Mono can run the IronPython test suite
		
<h3>Runtime</h3>

	<p>Carlos implemented <a
	href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconpublisherpolicyfilesside-by-sideexecution.asp">publisher
	policies</a>

	<p>The generics code performance was largely improved by
	Michal Moskal and various bugs in the implementation have been
	fixed thanks to the <a href="http://www.nemerle.org">Nemerle
	Programming Language</a> team that is making extensive use of
	it.

	<p>Iron Python 0.9 works as well as all of its regression
	tests (Zoltan and Martin).  Notice that the IronPython
	regression tests need various Makefile fixes and some symlinks
	to cope with filename casing to work.

	<p>David Waite contributed LinkedList&lt;T&gt; implementation.

<h3>GDI+</h3>

	<p>Hisham, Jordi and Peter have adapted GDI+ to use Cairo 1.0
	instead of Cairo 0.3 which we were previously using.  This
	upgraded version of GDI+ is much faster and Windows.Forms
	application feel faster and smoother on Linux as a result.

	<p>As part of this upgrade numerous bugs were fixed and memory
	management was audited by Jordi and Peter to eliminate memory
	leaks. 
	
	<p>Rectangle drawing operations are faster by 30% now,
	blitting large images is 50% faster.

	<p>There are now 500 nunit tests for the library and many new
	contributions from Mainsoft.

<h3>Winforms progress</h3>

	<p>Alexander Olk contributed a new theme, the "nice" theme, a
	screenshot can be seen <a
	href="http://svn.myrealbox.com/blog/images/themenice.png">here</a>.

	<p>The first version of RichTextBox from Peter debuts in this
	release and includes an RTF parser.
	
	<p>More news on Winforms development are <a
	href="http://svn.myrealbox.com/blog/archive/2005/08/30/origin_of_supernatural_probabi">here</a>. 
	
<h3>Globalization/Internationalization: String Collation.</h3>

	<p>We have a completely new reimplementation of the CompareInfo
	infrastructure in this release of Mono, a managed
	implementation of string collation that is compatible with
	Windows collation.

	<p>Atsushi Enomoto worked on this project for the past four
	months before we merged it on this release.  Currently the
	code has to be turned on by setting the
	MONO_USE_MANAGED_COLLATION environment variable to "yes"

	<p>In the past we had used ICU but this approach had two
	problems: the code lived in the C world and the cost of
	transitioning from managed to unmanaged code for string
	collation was fairly high.

	<p>ICU also implemented different semantics than those exposed by
	.NET and a mapping of one system into the other was not really
	possible.

<h3>Globalization/Internationalization: Region information.</h3>

	<p>Atsushi has also contributed a new framework and updated the
	RegionInfo information.

	<p>Encodings: Two new encodings are implemented: GB18030 and
	iso-2022-jp.

<h3>ADO.NET</h3>

	<p>Suresh deployed a new NUnit and Mono.Data-based testing
	framework for the System.Data namespace.
	
	<p>Suresh implemented OdbcCommandBuilder and fixed various bugs
	in System.Data.Odbc and SqlClient Providers.

	<p>Dan implemented OracleCommandBulder based on
	SqlCommandBulder so you can do inserts, updates, deletes
	in a DataTable without having to create the SQL to do
	the inserts, updates, and deletes as well as adding support
	for OUTPUT parameters and the TIMESTAMP Oracle 9i data type. 
	
	<p>implemented a quick-and-dirty way to get primary key info
	and table info (Schema Info support in OracleDataReader)
	neccessary to support OracleCommandBulder
	
	<p>Dan implemented SybaseCommandBuilder; however, it does not
	work since the SybaseDataReader needs to have SchemaInfo
	command behavior implemented
	
	<p>Fixes to SqlCommandBuilder to get updates to work based on
	what Suresh did

<h3>Mono.Data.Sqlite</h3>

	<p>Thomas Zoechling, Jeroen Zwartepoorte and Dan Morgan
	created various bugfixes and a patch to add named parameters.

	<p>Joshua made it so several commands can be executed in a
	single invocation, instead of just the first one (semicolon
	delimited commands).

<h3>Assembly Version Numbers</h3>

	Mono assemblies version now default to the beta version
	numbers (2.0.0.0 and 8.0.0.0 series, by Kornel Pal).

<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<p>A major rewrite to ASP.NET is now available as part of this
	release, the highlights of the new code include:

	<ul>
		<li>Tests: 67,700 lines of new tests:
		<ul>
			<li>NUnit test suite for about 50% of the controls.

			<li>Extensive standalone tests.

			<li>JSUnit (see section later).
		</ul>

	        <li>Unmanaged I/O: the new implementation uses
	        unmanaged buffers for uploads (HTTP POST for example)
	        and content generation as opposed to the managed
	        buffers that we have today, which greatly reduces the
	        pressure on Mono's GC and also avoids redundant copies
	        of data by sharing buffers as much as possible
	        improving performance.
	
	        <li> Use of TCP Cork on Linux to avoid TCP glitches
	        and delays, this reduces the latency to get a full
	        page.
	
	        <li>Support for Linux sendfile to transfer static
	        pages (support for more platforms will come later).
	
	        <li>XSP now transfers Socket ownership to the
	        AppDomain to avoid round trips and expensive AppDomain
	        boundary crossing increasing performance.
	
	        <li>New controls: about 40% of the existing controls
	        were rewritten from scratch with test suites to
	        validate their output.
	
	        <li>New application pipeline: a new iterators-based
	        design reduces the complexity and increases the
	        maintainability of the old version.
	
	        <li>Support for HttpClientCertificate on XSP, soon to
	        come to Apache.
	
	        <li>Improved tracing support.
	
		<li>Latency has been reduced in various key places and
		the new unmanaged buffers accelerate the processing of
		medium and large sized pages (small pages remain about
		the same speed) and large uploads wont disrupt your
		Mono process.
	</ul>

	<p>The new ASP.NET stack is brought to you by Eyal Alaluf,
	Peter Bartok, Jackson Harper, Miguel de Icaza, Ben Maurer,
	Jordi Mas, Gonzalo Paniagua, Dick Porter, Sebastien Pouliot and
	Chris Toshok.

<h3>ASP.NET Configuration</h3>

	<p> The System.Configuration assembly has been mostly
	implemented and integrated into ASP.NET. Now it is possible to
	read web configuration files using the new configuration
	object model (Lluis).
	
	
<h3>XSP Web Server</h3>

	<p>XSP has been split up in two: Mono.WebServer.dll and
	xsp.exe.  XSP only handles command line parsing and
	Mono.WebServer.dll is the assembly that implements the
	functionality.  

	<p>Mono.WebServer.dll is an embeddable library that can be
	used to host ASP.NET in your own applications.  In the past
	people resorted to making a replica of XSP in their
	applications if they wanted to host ASP.NET.  This was
	contributed by Brian Ritchie a few months back, and its
	finally on the main trunk.

	<p>The Mono.WebServer.dll deployment model follows
	the new <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment">Guidelines
	for Library Deployment</a> and there are versions available
	for running on the 1.x and 2.x profiles.

	<p>XSP now also takes advantage of certain Linux features like
	sendfile and TCP Cork to improve performance.

	<p>XSP also contains support for HTTPS connections using the
	--https flag by Brian Ritchie.

<h3>JScript.NET Compiler</h3>

	<p>Progress: JScript now passes 4586 tests of the Mozilla
	ECMAScript test suite out of 5994 (76.51%)

	<p>Cesar added various new features to the compiler:
	
	<ul>
		<p>Support for value types and reference types.
		<p>Support for conversions and boxing.
		<p>Exact support for numeric values.
		<p>Optimization when accessing literal's methods that belong its prototype.
		<p>Port Mozilla's decompiler for infrastructure that's used in closure's construction.
		<p>Report filename and line number on errors.
	</ul>

	<p>Marek implemented JScriptCodeProvider and stubbed
	JScriptCodeGenerator.

	<p>Florian contributed many updates to the JScript runtime as
	part of his collaboration in Google's Summer of Code project:

	<ul>
		<li>Library functions: Array.prototype, Number.prototype,
		String.prototype and many more.
		
		<li>Integrated the Mozilla test suite into Mono.
		
		<li>LateBinding logic including prototype chain look up.
		
		<li>Anonymous functions.
		
		<li>Decompilation of functions to their source code.
		
		<li>delete and other operators.
	</ul>

<h3>New: JSUnit</h3>

	<p>As part of the new ASP.NET testing framework Chris Toshok
	developed JSUnit: a new JavaScript unit test framework to
	automate running the tests for various web controls and
	validate that they do the right thing.

<h3>Monodoc</h3>

	<p>Monodoc now defaults to use the Mozilla rendering engine to
	display its values, thanks to Mario Sopena and the Google
	Summer of Code effort and it also uses CSS to render its
	pages.

	<p>Monodoc will now also show pending contributions that you
	might have in your file system as well as including search
	support.

<h3>Tools</h3>

	AL (assembly linker) can now sign, and delay-sign, assemblies
	and makecert can now generate PKCS#12 files (Sebastien);
	
<h3>Code Access Security</h3>

	<p>Sebastien continued his work on CAS:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Support for FullTrustAssemblies in policy
		resolution;
		
		<li>IsolatedStorage now supports user quotas (when the
		security manager is enabled);
		
		<li>PermissionRequestEvidence is now part of the
		evidences during policy resolution;
		
		<li>Many bugs and corner cases were fixed.
	</ul>

<h3>Mono's SSL Stack</h3>

	<p>Improvements to the asynchronous methods in SslClientStream
	and SslServerStream were contributed by JD Conley: they are
	now thread safe, support asynchronous handshaking plus various
	important fixes.
	
	<p>Support for _optional_ client-side mutual authentication (Sebastien).
	
	<p>Support for server-side mutual authentication (Sebastien)
	
	<p>Rewritten async support for Ssl[Client|Server]Stream (JD Conley);

<h3>Mono.Cairo</h3>

	<p>Hisham and John Luke have upgraded the Mono.Cairo API to match the
	recently released <a
	href="http://cairographics.org/introduction">Cairo 1.0</a> as
	well as providing documentation for the new API in Monodoc.

	<p>There are new Gtk and X11 samples included in the
	distribution. 

<h3>Mono.Posix</h3>

	<p>Mono.Posix: This assembly now provides a remoting channel
	based on Unix sockets. It is a standalone channel and does not
	require the System.Runtime.Remoting assembly to work (Lluis).

<h3>C#</h3>

	<p>Due to popular request, the C# compiler now reports precise
	error/warning location with both line and column numbers
	(Atsushi).

	<p>Support for the Namespace Alias Qualifier to the C# 
	compiler was added by Hari.

	<p>The compiler went through many bug fixes and a few internal
	structural changes as anonymous methods, iterators and partial
	classes start to get used by developers.  Contributors include
	Martin, Harinath, Marek, Miguel and Atsushi which has been on
	a bug fixing quest on this release.

	<p>Still missing for full 2.x support: external assembly alias
	and friend assemblies.

<h3>ilasm/monodis</h3>

	<p>Our IL assembler and disassembler for the first time are
	able to round trip all the Mono assemblies and we consider
	them finally complete for real use. 

	<p>Thanks to Ankit for fixing all the remaining issues.

<h3>VB.NET</h3>

	<p>Manjula and Sudha upgraded various pieces of the Basic
	compiler and its runtime.

<h3>Npgsql: Postgress provider.</h3>

	<p>Updates from Francisco Figueiredo:

	<p>Better metadata support. Thanks Josh Cooley (jbnpgsql at
	tuxinthebox dot net).

        <p>Added refcursor parameter support. Now, refcursors can be
	passed as arguments for functions.

        <p>Npgsql now can handle functions which return refcursor and
	setof refcursor. Now, results are returned as NpgsqlDataReader
	resultsets.  There is no need to explicitly call "fetch all
	..."

        <p>Critical bug fixed with ConnectorPool when creating
	MinPoolSize connections. Connections weren't properly
	handled. Thanks Josh Cooley (jbnpgsql at tuxinthebox dot net)

<h3>Firebird provider</h3>

	<p>From Carlos:

	<o>Support for the new INSERT ... RETURNING statement of
	Firebird v2.0

	<p>Added support to the new CREATE SEQUENCE and SET GENERATOR
	statements to the FbBatchExecution class.

	<p>Add parameter information for DML statements and allow the
	configuration of quoted identifiers usage to the DataAdapter
	Configuration Wizard.


<a name="install"/></a> <h2>Installing
	Mono 1.1.9</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.9 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.9

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE, SLES, Fedora Core, RHEL,
	MacOS and Windows in a variety of platforms 
	available from our web site from the
        <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">download</a>
