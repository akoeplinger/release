<h1>Mono 1.1.4 Development Release</h1>


	<p>Mono 1.1.4 is the fourth release on the development series
	of Mono. The Mono 1.1.x series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

	<p>We consider Mono 1.1.4 stable enough to recommend it for all users.
	Those upgrading from the 1.0.x series should note that these notes
	only contain the differences between 1.1.3 and 1.1.4. All of the
	changes since 1.0 are documented in the following release notes:
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>, and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3">1.1.3</a>. Note that
	some of the changes mentioned in these notes are also present in the
	1.0.x series.

	<p>For users who can not make major changes to their environment, the 1.0.x series
	will still be maintained.

<h2>Changes since the last release</h2>

	<p>The following is a high-level description of the changes in
	the development release of Mono since the previous development
	release in December 9th.  190 reported bugs were fixed in this
	period of time.

	<p>Although this a development version, this release contains
	mostly bug fixes, speedups and tuning in every subsystem of
	Mono. Some key changes are:

<h3>Packages</h3>

	<p><b>New:</b> MacOS X packages now include the Cocoa# API for creating
	native applications.

	<p>On Linux, we have reduced the number of packages required
	to install Mono.
	
<h3>Security</h3>

	<p><b>New:</b> Sebastien has committed his Code Access Security (CAS)
	support, enable it by running mono with the `--security'
	flag.  For this release, the option enables:

	<ul>
        	<li>Policy resolution - including assembly-level
        	RequestMinimum, RequestOptional and RequestRefuse
        	attributes.
		
		<li>Declarative/Imperative demands;
		
		<li>Declarative stack modifiers (Assert, Deny and
		PermitOnly);
	</ul>
	
	<p><i>Note:</i> Although the CAS infrastructure is in place, the class
	libraries have not yet been audited and properly tagged for CAS use,
	this work is just starting. Some of this work will not be visible
	until the audit is complete.

	<p>IsolatedStorage has been updated to use
	assembly/appdomain evidences (but not the
	permissions).


<h3>C# Compiler: Important Changes</h3>

	<p><b>Important Change</b>: The compiler is now more strict in
	the lookup rules.  This might break code that compiled fine in
	the past, as we are now closer to the specification
	(Harinath).  Programs affected are, typically, those that use
	namespaces and types with the same name.


	<p>The warning level has been raised from 2 to 3, code that
	compiled without warnings will likely produce more messages on
	this new release (Marek).
	
	<p>We now do Decimal Constant folding (Marek).
	
	<p>Various bug fixes (From the triple M team: Miguel, Martin, Marek)

<h3>Cryptography</h3>

	<p>Many improvements were made in cryptographic performance, including 8% for
	SHA1, 5% for SHA256 and 20% for TripleDES and MACTripleDES. As well, weak
	key detection for DES is 16 times faster.
	
	<p>New padding modes ANSI X9.23 and ISO 10126 were implemented
	(for 2.0) for symmetric ciphers and MACTripleDES;

<h3>ASP.NET 2.0 features</h3>

	<p><b>New:</b> To use these features, you must use `xsp2' in your setup: 
	
	<p><b>Master Pages:</b> Lluis has implemented our framework
	for Master Pages.

	<p><b>Menus, Trees:</b> Support for dynamic menus on web pages
	(very cute!) and dynamic trees on ASP.NET controls have been
	implemented by Lluis.

	<p>Also: View and MultiView web controls.
	
        <p>Reorganized samples: now there are sample pages for all the
        new 2.0 controls in XSP.

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p><b>New:</b> The new implementation of Windows.Forms (we like to call it
	"Managed.Windows.Forms") is now the default, and the old code
	has been removed from this release.
	
	<p>It is now the default and it will be installed together
	with all the other libraries on the system.  Windows.Forms is
	still not complete, but making progress rapidly.

	</ul>
	
<h3>GDI+</h3>

	<p>GDI+ now ships with its own bundled version of Cairo.  This
	also should avoid interfering with the standard release and
	distribution process of Cairo. (Paolo)

<h3>Tools</h3>

	<p><b>New:</b> <b>prj2make</b>, a tool developed  by Francisco
	Martinez is  now part of the standard  Mono distribution.  You
	can use prj2make  to produce Makefiles that will  work on Unix
	for projects that use Visual Studio solutions.

	<p><b>gacutil:</b> No longer requires patches to work for RPM
	systems.

	<p><b>dtd2xsd:</b> A new tool to produce Xml Schema
	Definitions from an XML document that contains a Document Type
	Definition (DTD), by Atsushi.

	<p><b>ilasm:</b> Added support to strongname assemblies (-key
	flag).

	<p><b>certmgr:</b> can now download and import certificates into the stores (e.g.
	SSL, LDAPS), list existing certificate and remove them from a store.

	<p><p>New permview tool</b> can display assembly-level
	declarative security present in assemblies (RequestMinimum,
	RequestOptional and RequestRefuse).

<h3>XML World</h3>

	<p>System.XML 2.0 is completed, except for compiled XSLT
	(Atsushi). New features include:

	<ul>
        <li>XmlSchemaValidator is implemented. As well, significant
          refactoring on XML Schema validating reader has been done.
        <li>SchemaInfo on DOM is now provided.
        <li>There is new support for reading Binary content (Base64/BinHex).
	</ul>

	<p>RelaxNG now features a compact syntax writer.

	<p>RelaxNG has an experimental grammar inference engine.

<h3>System.Data World</h3>

	<p>A new test framework for connected behavior was developed
	by Sudha.
	
	<p>Suresh fixed many bugs in connected and disconnected modes
	in the System.Data stack.  Appasamy has also contributed bug
	fixes to the SqlClient and Odbc providers.
	
	<p>Many bug fixes were made for DataSet, including some from Ankit
	Jain.

	<p>DataViews are much faster now (Atsushi).

<h3>Profiler</h3>

	<p><b>New:</b> A new statistical profiler is included in the default Mono
	profiler, to use do:

	<pre>
	mono --profile=default:stat
	</pre>

	<p>Additions to the profiler API were made by Ben and Paolo. These
	changes enable Ben's experimental heap profiler to work. The profiler
	can be found in the `heap-prof' module of SVN. Beagle has reported
	great success with this tool.

<h3>Mono Embedding</h3>

	<p><b>New:</b> Using the special library name "__Internal" will resolve
	symbols against the main executable.  Particularly useful
	for users embedding the Mono runtime.

	<p><b>New:</b> Simplified threads for embedding: Starting with this release Mono will
	no longer start a separate thread for running the main
	application.  Embedders take note about this change, see the
	updated sample program for details.
	
	<p>We have now the beginnings of a framework to document the
	complete Mono public API.

<h3>Ahead of Time Compilation</h3>

	<p>Position Independent Code (PIC) is generated for both x86 and x86-64.
	Users with multiple mono processes will notice a memory
	reduction if AOT is used.
	
	<p>Ahead-of-Time compilation can be done on demand by using
	the MONO_AOT_CACHE environment variable which will toggle
	auto-batch-compilation on demand (Zoltan).
	
<h3>Performance</h3>

	<p>Exception throwing is now a lot faster (Paolo, Zoltan).

	<p>SSA-based partial redundancy elimination has been updated. Work
	on Alias Analysis is being done to enhance this optimization (Massi).

	<p>Arrray Bounds Check (ABC) Removal removes more checks (Massi).
	
	<p>Many System.Threading.Interlocked operations are implemented
	using inline assembly for the x86 (Patrik).

	<p>Various peephole and Linear Scan improvements have been made
	to increase code quality (Ben).

	<p>Throw blocks are now placed in an out-of-bound block to
	improve locality and branch prediction (Zoltan).

	<p>Remoting for TCP and HTTP transport is vastly faster now
	(few orders of magnitude) this change was done by Lluis.

	<p>Lluis also implemented a more scalable threadpool for
	remoting for incomming connections.

<h3>Memory Usage</h3>

	<p>The VM went on a memory diet at various levels.

	<p>Many metadata structures are now delay-loaded, reducing memory
	consumption, especially in long running GUI applications. (Ben)

	<p>Memory leaks have been audited, especially in terms of application
	domain unloading. (Paolo, Zoltan, Ben)

	<p>The symbol file for --debug is now loaded with mmap, reducing
	memory consumption by a few megabytes (Ben).

	<p>XmlDocument and its helper classes now use less memory. (Atsushi)

<h3>Test Suites, Build System</h3>

	<p>`make distcheck' now runs the regression tests during
	the release.  This existed in 1.1.3, but there many more tests
	on this release.

	<p>We are getting close to have all the regression test suites
	enabled by default on our tinderbox setup.

<h3>Mono.Posix</h3>

	<p>Jon added support for FILE handles in the
	Mono.Unix.StdioFileStream class.

	<p>The Mono.Posix namespace is now obsolete, we recommend the
	use of the classes and methods in the Mono.Unix namespace (the
	assembly is the same one: Mono.Posix.dll).
	
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

	<p>For those tracking the mailing lists, we have included the
	new number formatter from Kazuki Oikawa and the test cases
	from Akira Mei.  This closed a large number of bugs.
	
<h3>Summary of C# 2.0 features supported</h3>

	namespace alias qualifier, external assembly alias, fixed size
	buffers and friend assemblies.

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.4</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.4 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.4

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE 9, SUSE 9.1, Red Hat 9, SLES
        8, Fedora Core 1, Fedora Core 2 and MacOS X are available from
