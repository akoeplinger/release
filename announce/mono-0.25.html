<h3>Mono 0.25 Release</h3>
		
<p>Hello everyone,</p>

	<p>A new release of the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> runtime and SDK is
	available for UNIX and Windows.  Packages for various
	distributions are also available from our download page.</p>

	<p>This is a delicious release of Mono: so many new things have
	been improved, implemented, fixed, and tuned from the last
	release that it is hard to not be excited about it.</p>

	<p>Our contract with SourceGear has had a big impact in Mono.
	The team at Ximian has been working on three areas to pass the
	rigorous tests provided by the SourceGear team:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>
		  <b>SOAP Web Services client implementation.</b>

		  <p>This includes both the SOAP support classes as well
		  as a complete rewrite of the XmlSerializer by Lluis.</p>
	 	</li>

		<li><b>Scalability</b>

		  <p>The SourceGear Vault software and its regression
		  test suite require a much better implementation of
		  our HTTP client so we have rewritten it completely
		  for scalability.</p>

		<li> <b>Robustness</b>

		  <p>Plenty of changes for robustness and tests for
		  stability were added.  The new io-layer changes from
		  Dick remove the handle limits that we had in the
		  past. </p>
	</ul>

	<p>With this release we are able to run their Vault command line
	software out of the box. </p>

	<p>The MonoDoc tool which includes API documentation for both
	.NET classes, Gtk# has been updated to include the contents of
	the Mono tutorial (thanks to Lee and Johannes for their work
	on the provider).</p>

<h3>3. Features</h3>

	<p>This summary does not make justice to the hard work that
	has gone into this release, so this is just a high-level
	overview.</p>

<h4>Java</h4>

	<p>This release can run IKVM (<a
	href="http://www.ikvm.net">http://www.ikvm.net</a>) out of the
	box, and it can also run Eclipse with the add-on found at:
	<a href="http://www.nexus.hu/vargaz">http://www.nexus.hu/vargaz</a></p>

<h4>IL Assembler</h4>

	<p>Jackson has made a tremendous amount of work on the Mono IL
	assembler.  All the major features in the assembler are now
	complete.</p>

	<p>The big missing pieces now are: debugging support, marshalling
	support, better error messages and generics support and of
	course bug fixing.</p>

<h4> Security Improvements</h4>

	<p>Sebastien Pouliot reports the following changes since
	0.24</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Changed System.Random to use a better implementation
		(algorithm from Knuth) (Ben).

		<li>Updated most class definitions for framework 1.1
		compatibility.

		<li>Fixed PKCS1MaskGenerationMethod to implement PKCS#1
		MGF1 (MS implementation is broken) which corrected our
		support for OAEP padding.

		<li>More generic PKCS#1 handling so RSA can sign any hash
		algorithm (defined in machine.config) which is far
		more flexible than the current .NET (limited to SHA1
		and MD5).

		<li>Implemented CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) for MUCH
		faster use of the RSA private key (decryption and
		signature) with Ben's help.

		<li>X509Certificate supports for CryptoAPI handles in constructor.

		<li>Released GUI certificate viewer for both SWF and GTK#
		(not yet part of the normal build).

	</ul>

<h4>System.Drawing</h4>

	<p>System.Drawing has support for multiple-backends; Alexandre
	Pigolkine has added a new backend based on Xr (<a
	href="http://xr.xwin.org">http://xr.xwin.org</a>) to the
	repository.</p>

	<p>This backend is particularly interesting, because Xr
	implements the PDF imaging system, which is exactly what is
	required to implement all the features in System.Drawing on
	multiple platforms.</p>

	<p>Today we have three implementations of System.Drawing: XrImpl,
	Win32Impl and GTKImpl.  XrImpl being the one we will use on
	UNIX systems on the long run.   </p>

	<p>Codecs for BMP and JPEG were added (they use directly the
	underlying system libraries).</p>

<h4>System.Windows.Forms</h4>

	<p>Aleksey Ryabchuk continues to implement plenty of controls on
	the Win32/WineLib based implementation of it as well as
	improving focus, keyboard navigation, common dialog boxes and
	layout computation.</p>

	<p>Joel Basson and Philip Van Hoof continued to improve the
	Gtk-based port of Windows.Forms.</p>

<h4>XmlSerializer</h4>

	<p>Lluis worked on a new implementation of the XmlSerialization
	classes in record time.  The XmlSerializer is the foundation
	for the Soap web services and is also one of the neatest
	features in the .NET Framework.</p>

	<p>It is possibly the best way of dealing with XML documents that
	I have found so far, and I am kept wondering, why did I bother
	processing XML in any other way before.</p>

<h4>Web Services</h4>

 	<p>The Web services classes support both RPC and Document,
	processing as well as Literal and Encoded mechanisms.  We have
	only implemented the client side so far, but most of the
	infrastructure is in place for authoring the server-side web
	services. </p>

	<p>Erik has written the beginning of our WSDL compiler, but this
	compiler has not been checked into the repository yet, so
	today you need to compile your WSDL files using the Microsoft
	framework tools.</p>

	<p>Gonzalo rewrote our Http client to conform to HTTP 1.1, and
	support all the features in the .NET class library.</p>

<h4>Remoting: Soap Formatter</h4>

	<p>The .NET Framework supports also a Remoting-based SOAP
	implementation.  Jean-Marc ANDRE has contributed a new
	implementation of
	System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap</p>

<h4>XSLT Extension Objects</h4>

	<p>Joshua Tauberer has written extension object support for XSLT;
	these are used extensively by the new Monodoc (which will be
	released shortly after Mono 0.25).</p>

<h4>XML Library.</h4>

        <p>Atsushi Eno continued to improve our XML support and was
	joined by Ben Maurer in optimizing the XML class libraries.
	We now allocate about one fifth as much memory while having a 20%
        speed gain.</p>

<h4>Pluggable Profiling Interface</h4>

	<p>Paolo has made the profiling code modular.</p>

	<p>The user can provide new modules to perform profiling-like
	operations on methods at runtime (see documentation).</p>

	<p>The existing profiler has been turned into a module on its
	own, and we are also shipping a sample code-coverage
	instrumentation tool.</p>

	<p>This interface will be of particular interest to anyone
	building advanced tool, or who needs special tracing and
	debugging facilities in the runtime.</p>

<h4>Custom Marshallers</h4>

	<p>We now support Custom Marshallers.  This allows fine-grained
	control over the marshalling and de-marshalling of values
	during P/Invoke.  If the default marshalling schemes provided
	by Mono are not exactly what you need, you can now manually
	tune the marshalling to be anything you can think of.</p>

<h4> JIT Performance and Runtime Enhancements</h4>

 	<p>Plenty of exciting low-level development, but the high
	level overview is: faster JITing and faster code generated.</p>

	<p>Paolo and Dietmar added support for tail calls and
	thread-static variables and faster type checking.</p>

	<p>Many performance enhancements have been added to the JIT: faster
 	handling of valuetypes, faster calls to some internal helper
 	functions, faster access to two-dimensional arrays.</p>

	<p>Dick reworked chunks of the IO-layer to remove the hardcoded
	limits, and fixed multiple bugs on it.</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>

	<p>Our head of testing, Nick Drochak reports that we have managed
	to get our regression test suite to run fully with .NET 1.1;
	Ville was responsible for getting many of our System.IO tests
	running on .NET, those were previously failing.</p>

	<p>Patrik Kalkman responded brilliantly to the teams' call for
	more unit tests.  He contributed some very nice
	SingleFormatter and DoubleFormatter tests.</p>

	<p>The good news in summary: we are down to 50 tests failing down
	from 200+ just a few weeks ago.   There are plenty of tests,
	but we need even more, here is the current state:</p>

	<ul>
		<br>corlib: 1855 tests
		<br>Microsoft.VisualBasic: 41 tests
		<br>Mono.Security.Win32: 25 tests
		<br>Mono.Security: 27 tests
		<br>System: 134 tests
		<br>System.Configuration.Install: 1 tests
		<br>System.Data: 503 tests
		<br>System.Security: 101 tests
		<br>System.Web.Services: 5 tests
		<br>System.XML: 423 tests
	</ul>

	<p>It would be nice to use Paolo's new profiling code together
	with NUnit tests to find out how much of the API we are
	currently exercising.</p>

<h4>Optimizations</h4>

	<p>Nick Drochak, who typically is a C# developer has now gone
	into the low-level code optimization world, and implemented
	the optimization to improve the following pattern:</p>

	<tt>
		(long) uinta * (long) uintb
	</tt>

	<p>That pattern is used all over our cryptography classes, and
	has increased the speed of them, and got a 20% performance
	increase on the regression test suite for the integer code.</p>

<H4>Mono Basic Compiler</h4>

	<p>Marco has been very busy with the compiler: Plenty of bug
	fixes in the compiler: methods without arguments do not need
	parentheses; Various operators fixed; Endregion fixes; Late
	binding support; Multi-line statements;  Redim.</p>

	<p>Rafael fixed the Mono.GetOptions and improved some bits of the
	compiler.</p>

<h4>JScript</h4>

	<p>Cesar has checked in the initial code to perform semantic
	analysis on the JScript compiler</p>

<h4>System.Data and System.Web Updates</h4>

	<p>ADO.NET and ASP.NET got fixes from Ville Palo and Gonzalo:
	many more regression tests, many fixes, and many
	improvements.  These benefit XSP directly.</p>

<h4>Gtk# bundle</h4>

	<p>This release from Ximian includes Gtk# packages for a couple
	of distributions.</P>

<h4>Documentation</h4>

	<p>This release also ships with MonoDoc.  MonoDoc has a few new
	features: Joshua has redone our ECMA provider, so the
	documentation is nicer, it has more features, and all the
	links finally work.</p>
	
	<p>Lee and Johannes worked to get us a new provider for
	MonoDoc: this new provider integrates the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/tutorial">Mono Tutorial</a> into
	the documentation browser.</p>

	<p>We need help continuing our Gtk# documentation effort, the
	.NET documentation effort, and finally improving our tutorial
	effort as well.  If you are interested, check the
	mono-docs-list@ximian.com mailing list.</p>


<h4>Bug Fixes</H4>

	<p>And of course, plenty of bug fixes everywhere: class
	libraries, compilers, tools, documentation, runtime,
	and assembler.
