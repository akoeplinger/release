<h1>Mono 1.1.8 Development Release</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.1.8 is the eight release on the development series
	of Mono. The Mono 1.1.x series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

	<p>We consider Mono 1.1.8 stable enough to recommend it for all users.
	Those upgrading from the 1.0.x series should note that these notes
	only contain the differences between 1.1.7 and 1.1.8.   All of the
	changes since 1.0 are documented in the following release notes:
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3">1.1.3</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4">1.1.4</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.5">1.1.5</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.6">1.1.6</a> and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.7">1.1.7</a>.

<h3>Features</h3>

	<p>Visual Studio solution to build Mono runtime natively on
	Windows. 
	
<h3>Code Access Security</h3>

	<p>Sebastien progress in this release:

	<li>
	<ul>AppDomain based sandboxes are supported (limited by
	#74411);
	
	<ul>Stack propagation for async code, threads and SWF;
	
	<ul>Default policies (like LocalIntranet, Internet...) are now supported;

	</li>

	<p>The new features allows NRobot 0.20
	(http://home.gna.org/nrobot/) to "work" (as much as the
	permissions are currently present in the class libraries) on
	Mono 1.1.8 with a single modification (change the imperative
	assert in NRobot/Engine/GameArena.cs to a declarative assert).

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>We have drag and drop on X and win32 now.

	<p>Jordi's DataGrid debuts.

<h3>ASP.NET 2.x controls</h3>

	<p>Lluis completed various new controls for ASP.NET 2.x:
	ImageMap, Wizard, SiteMapDataSource and SiteMapPath.

<h3>Reflection</h3>

	<p>Lluis added support for producing debugging information
	from Reflection.Emit.   This means that all the
	Reflection-based compilers and VMs will be able to produce
	debugging information and have the Mono debugger step through
	the code. 
	
<h3>Packaging</h3>

	<P> mono-ikvm has been merged into mono-core. Should make it easier
        for people to get ikvm

	<p> mono-nunit is back with the nunit stuff. Needed for mono-tools

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.8</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.8 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.8

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE, SLES, Fedora Core, RHEL are
	available from our web site from the
        <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">download</a>
        section.

	<p>MacOS and Windows packages will be uploaded soon.

	<p><b>Source code:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<ul>
	  <li>Mono Source Code: FIXME <a href="">mono-1.1.8.tar.gz</a>
	</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>
        
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	 source code is very simple.
	
	 <p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-1.1.8.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-1.1.8
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
	
</pre>
