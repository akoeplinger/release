<h1>Mono 1.1.6 Development Release</h1>


	<p>Mono 1.1.6 is the sixth release on the development series
	of Mono. The Mono 1.1.x series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

	<p>This is a micro-release and only contains some bug fixes:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Packaging Fixes:</b> Mono 1.1.5 RPM packages
		were compiled with an option that would allow users to
		downgrade their kernel, but the feature had not been
		tested.

		<p>One simple fix was to compile from source code, but
		we decided that redoing the packages was the major
		burden of a release, and we could include a few other
		fixes.

		<li><b>Apple G3 Support:</b> The G3 was not previously
		supported, this version adds support for it.

		<li><b>KEvent on BSD</b>: A crashing bug on BSD-based
		systems (OSX included) were fixed.

		<li><b>Cookies:</b> A couple of small bugs were found
		on the Cookie handling with certain web sites, this
		has now been fixed.

		<li><b>AMD compilation:</b> Makes sure that libraries
		are installed in lib, not lib64.

		<li><b>Compilation:</b> Compilation on some older
		systems has been fixed.

		<li><b>SQL Server reset:</b> The reset operation is
		not supported on all SQL servers.
	</ul>

	<p>We consider Mono 1.1.6 stable enough to recommend it for all users.
	Those upgrading from the 1.0.x series should note that these notes
	only contain the differences between 1.1.4 and 1.1.6.   All of the
	changes since 1.0 are documented in the following release notes:
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3">1.1.3</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4">1.1.4</a> and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.5">1.1.5</a>. Note that
	some of the changes mentioned in these notes are also present in the
	1.0.x series.

	<p>For users who can not make major changes to their environment, the 1.0.x series
	will still be maintained.

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.6</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.6 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.6

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE, SLES, Fedora Core, RHEL are
	available from our web site from the
        <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">download</a>
        section.

	<p>MacOS and Windows packages will be uploaded soon.
	</blockquote>
        
	<p><b>Source code:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<ul>
	  <li>Mono Source Code: <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.6/mono-1.1.6.tar.gz">mono-1.1.6.tar.gz</a>
	</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>
        
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	 source code is very simple.
	
	 <p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-1.1.6.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-1.1.6
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
	
</pre>
