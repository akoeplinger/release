<h1>Mono 1.1.2 Development Release</h1>
<p>Mono 1.1.2 is the second release on the development series of
Mono and it is not intended to be used for production as it is
undergoing internal changes. Those interested in a stable release
should use the Mono 1.0.xx series.</p>
<p>The Mono 1.1.xx series will eventually lead to the next stable
milestone: Mono 1.2.</p>

<h2>Changes since the Mono 1.1.1 release</h2>
<p>The following is a high-level description of the changes in the
development release of Mono since the previous development release
in September 22nd.</p>
<p>Although this a development version, this release contains
mostly bug fixes, speedups and tuning in every subsystem of Mono.
In addition to that, some key new changes are:</p>
<h3>C# Compiler</h3>
<p>The C# compiler now supports anonymous methods, you can now
write code like this:</p>
<pre class="shell">

        Button b = new Button ();
        b.Clicked += delegate {
                Console.WriteLine ("I got clicked");
        }
        
        
</pre>
<p>For more information on anonymous methods, you can read this
<a href=
"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0yw3tz5k.aspx">introduction</a>
or read the <a href=
"http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/1/6/81682478-4018-48fe-9e5e-f87a44af3db9/SpecificationVer2.doc">
C# 2.0 specification</a> (Miguel).</p>
<p>Today Mono 1.1.2's C# compiler supports <a href=
"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0yw3tz5k.aspx">anonymous
methods</a>, <a href=
"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/dscyy5s0.aspx">iterators</a>,
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/wa80x488.aspx">partial
classes</a>, <a href=
"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/79b3xss3.aspx">static
classes</a> and <a href=
"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/441722ys.aspx">inline warning
control</a> from the 2.0 specification. <a href=
"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/512aeb7t.aspx">Generics</a> are
supported as well on the branched `gmcs' compiler (included).</p>
<p>Added support for encoding security permission attributes as
part of the ongoing CAS support in Mono (Marek).</p>
<p>Still missing for full 2.0 support: nullable types, namespace
alias qualifier, external assembly alias, property accessor
accessibility, covariance and contravariance, fixed size buffers
and friend assemblies.</p>
<p>Many new errors and warnings reported.</p>
<h3>Basic Compiler</h3>
<p>Improved the compiler performance by back porting some
improvements from mcs to mbas, compilations that used to take
thirty seconds now take one second (Jambunathan).</p>
<p>Anirban continued making improvements to the language support
and Jambu redesigned the test suite layout.</p>
<h3>libgdiplus and System.Drawing</h3>
<p>We no longer depend on Cairo internals.</p>
<h3>Windows.Forms and System.Drawing</h3>
<p>Work on the new managed implementation of Windows.Forms
continues, we hope that by the next release the new implementation
completely replaces the existing version during the build
process.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of progress in this area, Windows.Forms
is not yet ready for most people testing it.</p>
<p>Folks interested in helping with the implementation might want
to go to the #mono-winforms channel on the irc network at
irc.gnome.org.</p>
<h3>Debugger</h3>
<p>Chris and Martin worked on the debugger support, the runtime now
contains some of the new hooks required by the new debugger. The
debugger currently can only be obtained from CVS.</p>
<p>The debugger is available from CVS, in the module
`debugger'.</p>
<h3>2.0 features</h3>
<p>Zoltan has added various Reflection.Emit features from the 2.0
API.</p>
<p>Extensive changes to the Mono runtime for improving our generics
support.</p>
<h3>System.Web</h3>
<p>The web support has been fine tuned and optimized, the number of
requests per second went from 70 to 550.</p>
<p>A big memory leak that would show up on long running servers has
been plugged.</p>
<h3>Xml World</h3>
<p>The Mono XQuery implementation has moved to a separate assembly
Mono.Xml.Ext in lieu and will be available for both the 1.x and 2.x
profiles.</p>
<h3>JIT Ports</h3>
<p>Updated the PowerPC, SPARC, AMD64 ports of Mono.</p>
<p>S390 port by Neale got its exception handling and prologs
fixed.</p>
<h3>JScript</h3>
<p>Cesar has implemented late binding support for the JScript
compiler. <a name="install" id="install"></a></p>
<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.2</h2>
<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.2 can not be installed in parallel
with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix. To work around this
issue, you must use a different prefix at configure time, for
example:</p>
<pre class="shell">
        
        $ ./configure --prefix=/devel
        
</pre>
<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to access the
Mono 1.1. Alternatively you can replace your Mono installation with
1.1.2.</p>
<p><b>Binary Packages:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE 9, SUSE 9.1, Red Hat 9, SLES 8,
