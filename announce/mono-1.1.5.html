<h1>Mono 1.1.5 Development Release</h1>


	<p>Mono 1.1.5 is the fifth release on the development series
	of Mono. The Mono 1.1.x series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

	<p>We consider Mono 1.1.5 stable enough to recommend it for all users.
	Those upgrading from the 1.0.x series should note that these notes
	only contain the differences between 1.1.4 and 1.1.5.   All of the
	changes since 1.0 are documented in the following release notes:
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3">1.1.3</a> and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4">1.1.4</a>. Note that
	some of the changes mentioned in these notes are also present in the
	1.0.x series.

	<p>293 bugs were fixed from the 1.1.4 release to the 1.1.5
	release.
	
	<p>For users who can not make major changes to their environment, the 1.0.x series
	will still be maintained.

<h2>Changes since the last release</h2>

	<p>The following is a high-level description of the changes in
	the development release of Mono since the previous development
	release in February 11th.
	
	<p>Although this a development version, this release contains
	mostly bug fixes, speedups and tuning in every subsystem of
	Mono. Some key changes are:

<h3>x86-64</h3>

	<p>The x86-64 version of Mono now uses SSE2 for floating point
	arithmentic instead of the x87 stack instructions (Zoltan).

<h3>ADO.NET</h3>

	<p>Plenty of bug reports were closed in ADO.NET by Suresh, and
	he also implemented the provider factory configuration
	classes.

	<p>Dan Morgan and did various fixes to the Oracle provider,
	and Hubert FONGARNAND contributed connection pooling for it.

<h3>Npgsql</h3>

	<p>From Francisco: Added support for implicit parameter stored
	procedure call. Parameters are added in order they were added to
	NpgsqlCommand Parameters collection. This is the same style of calling
	stored procedures with SqlClient.

	<p>Added support for record return type functions. Thanks neri
	and Michel for heads up and tests.

	<p>Added Varchar support. Thanks Peter and Gustav for heads
	up.

	<p> Npgsql doesn't depend on System.Drawing and
	System.Windows.Forms (a.k.a SWF) when compiled with Mono. This
	dependency is only necessary to add design time support for
	VS.NET and so only enabled when compiling with csc. Thanks Eno
	and Rafael Teixeira for help.

	<p>Added support for updating output parameters when calling
	ExecuteReader(). Thanks Mike Griffin (mike dot griffin at
	mygenerationsoftware dot com) for heads up.
	
<h3>VB.NET Compiler</h3>

	<p>Manjula and Sudha continued work on expressions and
	statements (MID, TO, IS, various concatenations, ANDALSO,
	ORELSE, LIKE, and a few others; See ChangeLog for details) and
	statements; Finalized the implicit and explicit conversions.

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>Windows.Forms continues to improve in every part of the
	toolkit.  In addition to Jordi, Peter and Jackson's ongoing
	contributions, Alexander Olk contributed various of the common
	dialogs code; Jonathan Chambers contributed the Property Grid
	widgets and Geoff Norton continued to maintain the OSX driver.

<h3>XML Stack</h3>

	<p>XSLT QA: Andrew Skiba and Konstantin Triger from
          Mainsoft fixed several bugs on XSLT, DOM and XmlReaders.

	<p>Significant XSLT memory usage reduction has done (and
        it's still ongoing).
	  
        <p>New: we now have ISO DSDL Part 4 NVDL support as part of
        Commons.Xml.Relaxng.dll, accompanying several bugfixes on
        RELAX NG support (Atsushi).

<h3>New CAS features</h3>

	<p>Most of this was done by Sebastien, with technical support
	from our JIT team Paolo and Zoltan:

	<p>LinkDemand (JIT time) and it's special cases (icalls,
	P/Invoke and the [AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers] attribute);

	<p>InheritanceDemand (load time);

	<p>Demand for unmanaged code on P/Invoke, including support
	for the [SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity] attribute;

	<p>Support for new 2.0 security actions: DemandChoice,
	LinkDemandChoice and InheritanceDemandChoice (note: the Mono
	runtime doesn't yet encode the in the new binary format).

<h3>Bundles</h3>

	<p>Bundles will now also include any .config file in the
	bundle as well, removing another external depedency (Paolo). 

<h3>C# 2.0 extensions</h3>

	<p>This release includes: an implementation of <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/zycewsya.aspx">Fixed Size Buffers</a> by
	Marek Safar and <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx">Nullable
	Types</a> by Martin Baulig.

	<p>For your developer correctness pleasure, many more warnings
	and errors are reported on this release, special thanks go to
	Marek Safar for the extra careful work that has gone into
	adding the new error checking, and special thanks go to Hari
	for his ongoing work on keeping the bug count of the compiler
	low. 
	
<h3>Summary of C# 2.0 features supported</h3>
	
	<p>Today Mono 1.1.5's C# compiler supports <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0yw3tz5k.aspx">anonymous
	methods</a>, <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/dscyy5s0.aspx">iterators</a>,
	<a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/wa80x488.aspx">partial
	classes</a>, <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/79b3xss3.aspx">static
	classes</a>, <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/sea07341.aspx">covariance
	and contravariance</a>, <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/75e8y5dd.aspx">property
	accessor accessibility</a>,
	<a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/zycewsya.aspx">fixed
	size buffers</a> 

	and <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/441722ys.aspx">inline
	warning control</a> from the 2.0 specification.  <a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/512aeb7t.aspx">Generics</a>,
	<a
	href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx">Nullable
	Types</a> are supported as well on the branched `gmcs'
	compiler (included).

	<p>Still missing for full 2.0 support: namespace alias
	qualifier, external assembly alias and friend assemblies.

<h3>ASP.NET 2.0</h3>

	<P>The 2.0 ASP.NET stack now contains GridView (editing,
	paging, sorting are supported: server-side and client-side
	sorting). 

<h3>GC Tuning</h3>

	<p>Various optimizations to remove locks from critical paths,
	also a cleaner separation between the GC interact is being
	introduced in preparation for having multiple pluggable GC
	engines in Mono.  

	<p>The GC is more aggressive with finalization of objects,
	which has helped long-running applications (xsp) to keep the
	memory under control: in the past the heap would grow.

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.5</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.5 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.5

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE 9, SUSE 9.1, Red Hat 9, SLES
        8, Fedora Core 1, Fedora Core 2 and MacOS X are available from
	our web site from the
        <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">download</a>
        section.  A Red Carpet Mono channel is also available on these
        platforms.

    $ make
    $ make install
	
</pre>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Optional Packages</b><p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Libgdiplus is an optional packages. You only need
	it if you intend to use System.Drawing or Windows.Forms.
	
	<p>libgdiplus:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf libgdiplus-1.1.5.tar.gz
