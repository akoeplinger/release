<h1>New in Mono 1.2.5</h1>

<h2>Dynamic Language Runtime</h2>

	<p>This release fixes various issues that were exposed by
	IronPython 2.0 preview release and the Dynamic Language
	Runtime from Microsoft.   They are both functional on this
	release. 
	
<h2>C# Compiler</h2>

	<p>Scott Petterson implemented the following C# 3.0 features:

	<ul>
	    <li>Variable type inference (the "var" keyword).
	    <li>Anonymous types.
	    <li>Array type inference.
	    <li>Object initialization.
	    <li>Collection initialization.
	    <li>Automatic properties.
	</ul>

	<p>Marek Safar continued work on the LINQ grammar support and
	the underlying System.Core assembly support for it. 

	<p>The C# 3.0 support is enabled by passing the
	-langversion:linq option to the compiler.   In addition to the
	above the C# 3.0 compiler also supports: extension methods,
	lambdas and anonymous method generic type inference. 
	
<h2>Runtime</h2>

	<p>AOT is now supported for 2.0 assemblies (although generic
	calls are still not pre-compiled) [Zoltan].

	<p>Devirtualization optimization for sealed classes and
	methods, improving IronPython 2.0 pystone performance by 4%.
        Other programs can expect similar improvement [Rodrigo].

	methods (FIXME: need numbers from Rodrigo) [Rodrigo].

	<p><a
	href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=81663">Invocation
	of non-multicast delegate</a> methods has been increased by
	calling directly into the delegate, this improves IronPython
	2.0 (pystone) performance by 25% [Zoltan Varga].  Thanks to
	Dino Viehland from the IronPython team for pointing out the
	optimization.

	<p>Math.Min and Math.Max are now inlined for signed integers
	and String.OrdinalCompare has been tuned to use these, which
	results in a 2-3% performance increase in running PyStone with
	IronPython. 

	<p>The runtime will not poll in WaitHandles for local handles
	that are sleeping (this is still done for process-shared
	handles) [Dick Porter].

<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>Rodrigo Kumpera has added an IL verifier to Mono.

	<p>IL verifiers are not very useful for applications that run
	at full-trust level (their only use is to help in compiler
	development and sanity checking).  But we are now working
	towards <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">supporting
	Silverlight</a> in Mono which needs to provide limitations on
	what code can do, and cope with malicious code. 
	
<h2>Corlib</h2>

	<p>Completed support for RegionInfo.

	<p>Dictionary: Optimize and add implementation notes. Use a
	"mini-heap" to store the linked lists instead of the regular
	heap. Split arrays of structs into separate arrays to make the GC's
	life simpler (see bug 81879 for details). Make class serialization
	compatible with MS.NET.

	<p>Environment.GetFolderPath: Now checks for the existance of
	the XDG_DESKTOP_DIR, XDG_MUSIC_DIR and XDG_PICTURES_DIR environment
	variables when trying to find the requested path.
	
<h2>System.Core</h2>

	<p>Fresh implementation of TimeZoneInfo [Stephane Delcroix].

	<p>
	
<h2>System.Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>MaskedTextBox implementation [Rolf Bjarne].

	<p>ToolStripPainter, ToolStripSystemRenderer: new from
	Jonathan Pobst.
	
<h2>GDI+</h2>

	<p>Add missing checks in GdipGetPath[Types|Points] functions
	(based on parts of #81859 patch by Yves Bastide and Sebastien
	Pouliot). 

<h2>Cairo</h2>

	<p>The Mono Cairo API has been updated (Alp Toker), it will
	now expose Cairo 1.2 API entry points.   Application code
	should call CairoAPI.Version to obtain the version and
	determine if the needed features are available.
