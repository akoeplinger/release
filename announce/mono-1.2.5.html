<h1>New in Mono 1.2.5</h1>

<h2>Dynamic Language Runtime</h2>

	<p>This release fixes various issues that were exposed by
	IronPython 2.0 preview release and the Dynamic Language
	Runtime from Microsoft.   They are both functional on this
	release. 
	
<h2>C# Compiler</h2>

	<p>Scott Petterson and Marek Safar implemented the following
	C# 3.0 features:

	<ul>
	    <li>Variable type inference (the "var" keyword).
	    <li>Anonymous types.
	    <li>Array type inference.
	    <li>Object initialization.
	    <li>Collection initialization.
	    <li>Automatic properties.
	</ul>

	<p>Marek Safar continued work on the LINQ grammar support and
	the underlying System.Core assembly support for it. 

	<p>The C# 3.0 support is enabled by passing the
	-langversion:linq option to the compiler.   In addition to the
	above the C# 3.0 compiler also supports: extension methods,
	lambdas and anonymous method generic type inference.

<h2>Runtime</h2>

	<p>AOT now provides some support for 2.0 assemblies (although generic
	calls are still not pre-compiled) [Zoltan].

	<p>Devirtualization optimization for sealed classes and
	methods, improving IronPython 2.0 pystone performance by 4%.
        Other programs can expect similar improvement [Rodrigo].

	methods (FIXME: need numbers from Rodrigo) [Rodrigo].

	<p><a
	href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=81663">Invocation
	speed of non-multicast delegate</a> methods has been increased by
	calling directly into the delegate, this improves IronPython
	2.0 (pystone) performance by 25% [Zoltan Varga].

	<p>Math.Min and Math.Max are now inlined for signed integers
	and String.OrdinalCompare has been tuned to use these, which
	results in a 2-3% performance increase in running PyStone with
	IronPython. 

	<p>Massi and Paolo implemented a mechanism that reduces
	virtual table sizes for interface method invocations.
	The most visible change is in significant memory reduction
	for applications loading many interfaces (this happens for many 2.0
	apps because of the many additional interfaces arrays implement).

	<p>Optimized double to int conversions using SSE2 on x86 [Paolo Molaro].

	<p>Implemented proper caching of generic methods (provides a very large
	speedup for virtual generic method invocations) [Paolo Molaro].

<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>Rodrigo Kumpera has added an IL verifier to Mono.
	IL verifiers are not very useful for applications that run
	at full-trust level (their only use is to help in compiler
	development and sanity checking).  But we are now working
	towards <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">supporting
	Silverlight</a> in Mono which needs to provide limitations on
	what code can do, and cope with malicious code. 
	
	<p>HttpWebRequest can now be used with X.509 client certificates
	(only possible in the 2.0 profile) [Sebastien]
	<p>Added support X.509 Client Certificate Chains for SSL/TLS 
	[Roy Versteeg]
	<p>Fixed SSL/TLS not to require exportable private keys for client
	certificates [Roy Versteeg]
	<p>Implemented import and export of DSA keys CryptoAPI-compatible 
	BLOB (2.0) [Randolph Chung]
	<p>Added SafeBag handling to Mono.Security's PKCS#12 [Jay Miller]

<h2>Corlib</h2>

	<p>Completed support for RegionInfo.

	<p>Dictionary: Optimize and add implementation notes. Use a
	"mini-heap" to store the linked lists instead of the regular
	heap. Split arrays of structs into separate arrays to make the GC's
	life simpler (see bug 81879 for details). Make class serialization
	compatible with MS.NET.

	<p>Environment.GetFolderPath: Now checks for the existance of
	the XDG_DESKTOP_DIR, XDG_MUSIC_DIR and XDG_PICTURES_DIR environment
	variables when trying to find the requested path.
	
<h2>System</h2>

	<p>LocalFileSettingsProvider implementation is contributed
	[Noriaki Okimoto]. With this code, ApplicationSettingsBase now works
	like .NET (per-user settings are created in the user's (local)
	application data directory.

<h2>System.Core</h2>

	<p>Fresh implementation of TimeZoneInfo [Stephane Delcroix].

	<p>
	
<h2>System.Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>MaskedTextBox implementation [Rolf Bjarne].

	<p>ToolStripPainter, ToolStripSystemRenderer: new from
	Jonathan Pobst.
	
<h2>System.Drawing / Libgdiplus</h2>

	<p>Libgdiplus has been updated to use Cairo 1.4.6 [Sebastien]
	<p>Libgdiplus header, types and enums names are now much closer to
	MS GDI+. This should make it easier to use from C/C++ even if this
	was not the primary goal. [Sebastien, Yves Bastide]
	<p>Added support for 2bpp PNG and fixes for 4bpp PNG image palettes
	[Sebastien]
	<p>Added support for interlaced GIF bitmaps [Sebastien]
	<p>Added support for ColorMatrixFlag and Gray ColorMatrix in 
	ImageAttributes [Sebastien]
	<p>Implemented GdipDrawImagePointsRect[I] functions [Sebastien]
	<p>Multiple printing fixes (e.g. text size/position) 
	[Vladimir Dimitrov, Sebastien]

<h2>Cairo</h2>

	<p>The Mono Cairo API has been updated (Alp Toker), it will
	now expose Cairo 1.2 API entry points.   Application code
	should call CairoAPI.Version to obtain the version and
	determine if the needed features are available.
