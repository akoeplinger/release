<h1>New in Mono 1.2.6</h1>

<h2>ASP.NET AJAX Implementation</h2>

	<p>This release includes the engine developed by <a
	href="http://www.mainsoft.com/">Mainsoft</a> in the last few
	months that provides the ASP.NET AJAX stack on the server
	side.  This is the System.Web.Extensions assembly.

	<p>The ASP.NET AJAX engine is able to run the open source
	<a href="http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/">ASP.NET AJAX Toolkit</a>. 

	<p>On the client side, we are now bundling Microsoft's ASP.NET
	AJAX Client Library (which is released under the Microsoft
	Permissive License). 

<h2>Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>OSX support debuts with a native Quartz backend (no need to
	run your applications inside X11, although you still need X11
	installed as we use FreeType and font-config that are part of
	the X11 distribution on OSX) [Geoff, ???]

	<p>The Web browser control is introduced in this release.
	It has support for basic browsing, but support for
	manipulating the DOM is not yet supported.    This feature
	requires Mozilla and currently only works on Windows and Linux
	[Andreia]. 
	
<h2>Runtime Engine</h2>

	<p>Hazard pointers, to be used by lock-free parallel algorithms (Mark
	Probst). This improves stability with Thread.Abort-happy workloads.

	<p>Support for the PE32+ assembly file format [Paolo].

	<p>Support for Managed allocations: the runtime can now perform
	some allocations completely in managed code without the penalty of
	trasitioning to unmanaged code [Paolo].

	<p>Signifiantly reduced the runtime and memory overhead of providing
	all the additional interfaces of 2.0 vectors [Paolo].

	<p>Implemented lazy loading of the interface dispatch tables, improving
	memory usage [Paolo].

	<p>Support for the CoreCLR security system (used by
	Silverlight sandboxes) [Mark].

	<p>Reduced the size consumed by trampolines, in MonoDevelop's
	case this saves 160k of memory on startup (Paolo).

	<p>New Timer implementation, this version uses the ThreadPool
	and provides the proper semantics that people have been
	requesting [Paolo].
	
<h2>Silverlight Support</h2>

	<p>Silverlight 2.1 libraries are now part of the build (JB
	Evain).

<h2>ASP.NET</h2>

	<p>New mod_mono directives for controlling the life span of
	mod-mono-server (Marek Habersack).

	<p>A new tool "mconfig" can be used to easily extend your
	Web.config settings to include new features (like turning an
	existing ASP.NET app into an AJAX ASP.NET app).

<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>SslStream has been implemented (Atsushi).

	<p>The Cecil-based permview tool is now part of Mono, 
	replacing an older reflection based (and incomplete) version
	[Sebastien]

	<p>SSL/TLS thread-synchronization has been fixed. This 
	fixed LDAPS support over multiple threads [Sebastien]

<h2>System.Drawing / Libgdiplus</h2>

	<p>Libgdiplus has been updated to use Cairo 1.4.10 [Sebastien]

	<p>Special case for handling path/region excludes from 
	infinity [Yves Bastide]

	<p>Added GdipCloneFontFamily function [Dmitriy Lukinov, 
	Sebastien]

	<p>TextureBrush now supports transparent bitmaps [Sebastien]

<h2>LDAP support</h2>

	<p>The Mono's library Novell.Directory.Ldap has been
	synchronized with the Novell's CSHARP LDAP SDK (version
	2.1.8).  All the changes have been commited together.  [N
	Palaniappan]
	
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

	<p>Assembly Tuner and Assembly Linker (available as a preview
	in 1.2.5) (JB Evain).

	<p>System.Core updates: Marek Safar, Federico Di Gregorio

<h2>C# Compiler</h2>

	<p>Support for partial methods has been implemeted [Marek].
