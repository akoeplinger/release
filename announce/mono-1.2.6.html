<h1>New in Mono 1.2.6</h1>

<h2>ASP.NET AJAX Implementation</h2>

	<p>This release includes the engine developed by <a
	href="http://www.mainsoft.com/">Mainsoft</a> in the last few
	months that provides the ASP.NET AJAX stack on the server
	side.  This is the System.Web.Extensions assembly.

	<p>The ASP.NET AJAX engine is able to run the open source
	<a href="http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/">ASP.NET AJAX Toolkit</a>. 

	<p>On the client side, we are now bundling Microsoft's ASP.NET
	AJAX Client Library (which is released under the Microsoft
	Permissive License). 

<h2>FastCGI</h2>

	<p>This version of Mono ships with support for servers that
	speak FastCGI (like lighttpd).   This was developed by Brian
	Nickel during the summer as part of the Summer of Code.

	<p>Documentation for setting up sites with FastCGI and Mono is
	available <a
	href="http://mono-soc-2007.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/brian/FastCgi/doc/index.htm">here</a>. 

	<p>Robert integrated the work into the main distribution.

<h2>Windows.Forms</h2>

	<p>The Web browser control is introduced in this release.
	It has support for basic browsing, but support for
	manipulating the DOM is not yet supported.    This feature
	requires Mozilla and currently only works on Windows and Linux
	[Andreia].
	
	<p>OSX support debuts with a native Quartz backend.  This
	means that there is no need to run your applications inside
	X11, although you still need X11 installed as we use FreeType
	and font-config that are part of the X11 distribution on OSX)
	[Geoff, Will Johannson, Attacom ].  This is at this point a
	preview and not yet fully supported, but many applications now
	work.

	<p>To use Windows.Forms on MacOS, you should use the
	<tt>macpack</tt> tool to "wrap" your Windows.Forms application
	properly (so that users can double-click on it). 

	<p>WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext has been implemented,
	this allows callbacks from BackgroundWorker to run on UI
	thread.

	<p>Approximately 100 reported bugs fixed in this cycle (too
	many to go into the details).
	
<h2>Runtime Engine</h2>

	<p>Hazard pointers, to be used by lock-free parallel algorithms (Mark
	Probst). This improves stability with Thread.Abort-happy workloads.

	<p>Support for the PE32+ assembly file format [Paolo].

	<p>Support for Managed allocations: the runtime can now perform
	some allocations completely in managed code without the penalty of
	trasitioning to unmanaged code [Paolo].

	<p>Signifiantly reduced the runtime and memory overhead of providing
	all the additional interfaces of 2.0 vectors [Paolo].

	<p>Implemented lazy loading of the interface dispatch tables,
	improving memory usage.   This feature is available on x86,
	x86-64 and ARM systems [Paolo].

	<p>Support for the CoreCLR security system (used by
	Silverlight sandboxes) [Mark].

	<p>Reduced the size consumed by trampolines, in MonoDevelop's
	case this saves 160k of memory on startup (Paolo).

	<p>New Timer implementation, this version uses the ThreadPool
	and provides the proper semantics that people have been
	requesting [Paolo].

	<p>New Profiler implementation: there is a new profiler that
	logs all the profiling events into a log file (as opposed to
	keeping this information in memory) which enables processing
	of this information after the program has terminated and
	allows for external tools to be written to analyze the data
	[Massimiliano].

<h2>Silverlight Support</h2>

	<p>Silverlight 2.1 libraries are now part of the build (JB
	Evain).

	<p>To compile code that targets Silverlight, use the
	<tt>smcs</tt> command line compiler.  This preloads all the
	Silverlight assemblies and also enables the LINQ language
	version (-langversion:linq) by default. 

<h2>ASP.NET</h2>

	<p>New mod_mono directives for controlling the life span of
	mod-mono-server (Marek Habersack).

	<p>A new tool <tt>mconfig</tt> can be used to easily extend your
	Web.config settings to include new features (like turning an
	existing ASP.NET app into an AJAX ASP.NET app).

	<p>The new <tt>mono-asp-apps</tt> script is a tool that can be
	used by RPM-based distributions to install and remove ASP.NET
	applications from a system.  [FIXME: link to the ASP.NET
	application guidelines deployment]

	<p>Some key fixes allow ASP.NET with IronPython to work now
	[Lluis, Marek and Marek].
		
<h2>System</h2>

	<p>SslStream has been implemented (Atsushi).

	<p>System.Net.Mail has been vastly improved (Atsushi).

	<p>System.Net.NetworkInformation (Windows-only for now,
	Atsushi). 

	<p>Fixed a number of serial problems in 81967 by Lukasz
	Byczynski

	<p>The Cecil-based permview tool is now part of Mono, 
	replacing an older reflection based (and incomplete) version
	[Sebastien]

	<p>SSL/TLS thread-synchronization has been fixed. This 
	fixed LDAPS support over multiple threads [Sebastien]

<h2>System.Drawing / Libgdiplus</h2>

	<p>Libgdiplus has been updated to use Cairo 1.4.10 [Sebastien]

	<p>Special case for handling path/region excludes from 
	infinity [Yves Bastide]

	<p>Added GdipCloneFontFamily function [Dmitriy Lukinov, 
	Sebastien]

	<p>TextureBrush now supports transparent bitmaps [Sebastien]

>>>>>>> .r89497
<h2>LDAP support</h2>

	<p>The Mono's library Novell.Directory.Ldap has been
	synchronized with the Novell's CSHARP LDAP SDK (version
	2.1.8).  All the changes have been commited together.  [N
	Palaniappan]
	
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

	<p>Assembly Tuner and Assembly Linker (available as a preview
	in 1.2.5) (JB Evain).

	<p>System.Core updates: Marek Safar, Federico Di Gregorio

	<p>The new <tt>mono-test-install</tt> script can be used to
	check a Mono installation for common errors.

<h2>C# Compiler</h2>

	<p>Support for partial methods has been implemeted [Marek].

	<p>To enable this and other LINQ features from the language,
	you must use -langversion:linq in the command line.

	<p>The Silverlight compiler (smcs) has that enabled by
	default. 

<h2>Other</h2>

	<p>Work is underwary to complete the 2.0 API at least to keep
	the metadata in sync with the framework.   We would much
	rather have methods documented with TODO items or throwing
	exceptions that not having the methods defined.
