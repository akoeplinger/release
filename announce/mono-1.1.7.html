<h1>Mono 1.1.7 Development Release</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.1.7 is the seventh release on the development series
	of Mono. The Mono 1.1.x series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

	<p>We consider Mono 1.1.7 stable enough to recommend it for all users.
	Those upgrading from the 1.0.x series should note that these notes
	only contain the differences between 1.1.6 and 1.1.7.   All of the
	changes since 1.0 are documented in the following release notes:
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3">1.1.3</a>,
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4">1.1.4</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.5">1.1.5</a> and
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.5">1.1.6</a>.

<h3>Mono 1.1.7 overview</h3>

	<p>The Mono core is pretty much complete for the 1.2 release,
	at this point we are only waiting for Windows.Forms to be
	completed before we can ship it.  At this point we are
	scheduled to release Mono 1.2 in September.

	<p>In the meantime, Mono development has fallen into two
	categories:

	<ul>
		<li>New code: Windows.Forms, libraries from the 2.x
		profile (ASP.NET 2, ADO.NET 2), new compilers (JScript,
		Basic, C# 2.0).

		<br>ie, non-core components.

		<li>New VM features: cross-platform register
		allocator, new string collation framework, precise
		garbage collector.

		<br>These are being developed on either branches or on
		separate trees and do not affect trunk.
	</ul>

	<p>The above setup allows us to continue development without
	interfering with the stability of Mono 1.1.x.

<h3>New I/O Layer</h3>

	<p>In Mono 1.1.7 we are including Dick Porter's new IO-Layer,
	which is daemon-less.  Before 1.1.7 Mono would always launch
	an auxiliary process that would be used by multiple Mono
	programs to share information like: global mutexes (named
	mutexes), file sharing status per-file, process and thread
	status.

	<p>Mono no longer requires a separate shared process to
	provide the previous features, this has significantly improved
	Mono's I/O performance.   Beagle is three times as fast
	indexing files and xsp tripled its speed.

<h3>Http Client Interactions</h3>

	<p>In the past the HttpWebRequest could starve the ThreadPool
	and it would lead to deadlocks as documented <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/ThreadPool_DeadLocks">on our
	web site</a>.

	<p>Gonzalo deployed a new implementation that does not have
	these problems and can take advantage of Linux epoll or
	kqueue.

	<p>This code not only eliminated the potential deadlocks, but
	also improved the client http throughput by avoiding
	unnecessary context switches.

	<p>Also ReadWriteTimeout is supported and Abort works properly
        now.

<h3>FreeBSD support</h3>

	<p>Thanks to Bill Middleton support for i386 FreeBSD (tested
	against 5.4 and 6.x-CURRENT) is now available.
	
<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>Extensive progress on the Windows.Forms support code since
	the March 18th release.  Jackson wrote a new double-buffering
	framework to bring our implementation in line with the
	expected behavior.

	<p>Databinding is now supported on this release (simple and
	complex data binding), not all controls are ready though,
	controls that support it: ListBox, CheckedListBox and ComboBox
	(Jackson and Jordi).
	
	<p>Alexander Olk implemented the file dialogs and did various
	touch-ups to other dialogs and widgets.

	<p>Complete widgets: ImageListStreamer (Jackson),

	<p>Prototype widgets: DataGrid widget and data container
	widgets (Jordi) and RichTextBox (Peter)

<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<p>New ASP.NET 2.0 controls completed: ButtonField,
	DetailsView, FormView, GridView, CheckBoxField,
	HyperlinkField, ImageField, TemplateField by Lluis.

	<p>Implemented support for two-way bindings in ASP.NET,
	ObjectDataSource and various improvements to the Menu control.

	<p>Gonzalo added support for code render syntax inside
        non-server tags, ie., &lt;span &lt;%= (firefox) ? class="cool" : ""
        %&gt;&gt;

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>Hari and Marek continue the work on making the compiler
	comply more strictly to the C# specification.  In some areas
	the compiler is faster, and consumes less memory, but it also
	provides better error messages and includes many new warnings
	that before were ignored.

	<p>Martin synchronized the generics compiler codebase with our
	main compiler codebase.  Also all bug reported on the generics
	compiler (except two parsing errors) have now been fixed and
	the generics class libraries have been modified to match the
	Beta2 libraries. 

	<p>Marek implemented C# 2.0 conditional attributes and
	DefaultCharSet attribute.

<h3>SSL/TLS</h3>

	<p>Many important fixes from Sebastien:

	<ul>
		<li>Fixed asynchronous operations;
		<li> Fixed support for client-side certificates;
		<li>Performance enhancements;
	</ul>
	
<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>Continued work on the CAS from Sebastien (--security flag).

	<p>Exposed more of the Mono.Security libraries as the .NET 2.x
	framework includes more features.
	
<h3>New Assemblies.</h3>

	<p>The following assemblies are now functional:

	<p><b>System.Configuration.Install</b> Written by Muthu
	Kannan and Harinath Raja.

	<p><b>System.ServiceProcess</b>: Joerg Rosenkranz Completed
	the support and implemented the service host daemon.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

	<p>Cesar's effort on JScript continue, not the compiler
	implements:
	<ul>
		<li>Strict-Equality operators
		<li>Eval
		<li>RegularExpressionLiteral
		<li>For-in statement 
		<li>Custom constructors
		<li>Increment/Decrement operators
		<li>First-class functions 
	</ul>

	<p>Plus bug fixing.

	<p>The JScript's runtime support now supports:

	<ul>
	 	<li>ArrayConstructor's CreateInstance function 
	 	<li>ArrayPrototype's join method
	 	<li>JSFieldInfo's GetValue and SetValue functions
	 	<li>JScriptException's constructor
	 	<li>Initial implementation of LateBinding's CallValue and
	 	<li>SetIndexedPropertyValueStatic
	</ul>

<h3>Basic Language</h3>

	<p>Manjula, Sudha and Ankit continued working on the Basic
	compiler and the Basic runtime:

	<ul>
		<li>Implemented "End statement"
		<li>Support "Exit Function"
		<li>Support declaration of decimal numbers.
		<li>Support 'Or' argument of AttributeTargets in AttributeUsage
		<li> Conditional Constant Directives
		<li>Support expressions for directives
		<li>Support Reference Parameter when parameters and
		arguments are different
	</ul>

	<p>The runtime now features late binding: it is 75% complete.
	It works with sub, functions, properties and fields,
	arrays. Late binding fit in well with simple expressions (like
	in conditional expressions and arithmatic expressions).

	<p>Finally, there is support for default values using an
	attribute by round-tripping and patching the runtime.

<h3>ADO.NET</h3>

	<p>SQLServer: Added support for Asynchronous command execution
	(Ankit and Suresh).

	<p>Various disconnected mode improvements: loading
	datatables. 

	
<h3>Mono.Posix assembly</h3>

	<p>There is a new UnixListener and UnixClient classes in the
	Mono.Unix namespace.

<h3>Build System</h3>

	Users will have to do make at least once in Mono before they
	can do make in any directory.

<h2>Installing Mono 1.1.7</h2>
	
	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.7 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.7

	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for SUSE, SLES, Fedora Core, RHEL are
	available from our web site from the
        <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">download</a>
        section.

	<p>MacOS and Windows packages will be uploaded soon.
	</blockquote>
        
	<p><b>Source code:</b>
	<blockquote>
	<ul>
	  <li>Mono Source Code: <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.7/mono-1.1.7.tar.gz">mono-1.1.7.tar.gz</a>
	</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>
        
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	 source code is very simple.
	
	 <p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-1.1.7.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-1.1.7
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
	
</pre>
	</blockquote>
