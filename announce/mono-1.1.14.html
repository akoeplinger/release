<h1>Mono 1.1.14 Release</h1>

	<p>This is the first beta towards the release of Mono 1.2.   
	
	<p>Mono was branched at version 1.1.13 to become the stable
	version of Mono that is distributed by Novell on its
	enterprise products.   That series of releases are only
	getting bug fixes.

	<p>Before each release we run all of the regression tests on
	Mono, so we consider this release usable for deployment, but
	there will continue to be changes in various areas.  
	
	<p>All of the changes since 1.0 are documented in the
	following release notes: <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1">1.1.1</a>, <a

	<p>This release is mostly a bug-fix release, there are very
	few new developments.

<h2>What is new in Mono 1.1.14</h2>

<h3>Stack Traces</h3>

	<p>Sending the QUIT signal to a running Mono process will
	produce a stack trace of each thread.  This is a long
	requested feature to assist folks debugging multi-threaded
	applications (Zoltan).

<h3>Garbage Collection</h3>

	<p>Paolo upgraded our Garbage Collection engine to the latest
	publicly available version from Hans Boehm.

	<p>This version also contains many changes to allow for moving
	and compacting Garbage Collectors.

<h3>IO-Layer</h3>

	<p>MONO_SHARED_HOSTNAME can now be set to to a name for a file
	in the ~/.wapi directory.  This is used by applications which
	might change the hostname.

<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<p>Large file uploads are now supported.  It is now possible
	to specify in the &lt;httpRuntime&gt; section a value for the
	requestLengthDiskThreshold.  The default is 256k.  Any POST
	data larger than this will be stored on disk instead of in
	memory.  This is a feature found on ASP.NET 2.x that Mono
	exposes on both ASP.NET 1.0 and 2.0.

	<p>This allows people to do large posts of files without
	consuming large amounts of memory   (Gonzalo).
	
<h3>ASP.NET 2</h3>

	<p>Chris Toshok fixed Master Pages, nested pages should work
	now.

	System.Configuration.

	<p>Build Providers.


<h3>XML Performance</h3>

	<p>Atsushi tuned the XML stack significantly using XMLMark,
	some graphs of the progress are available <a
	href="http://monkey.workarea.jp/mono/xml/XMLmark">here</a>.

<h3>Runtime</h3>

	<p>The runtime will no longer produce g_assertions with
	invalid metadata, or invalid code, instead it will raise an
	exception (Paolo Molaro).

	<p>Jim Pubrick contributed a large test suite for CIL
	verification based on the ECMA spec.

	<p>The runtime now has a --wapi command line option to control
	the contents of the ~/.wapi directory.   --wapi=hps will show
	the currently active handles and --wapi=semdel will delete the
	semaphores used by Mono.   These tools used to be part of a
	development install of Mono, but they have now been made
	available to everyone.

<h3>System.Query</h3>

	<p>Alejandro Serrano contributed an implementation of
	System.Query to Mono.

	<p>Atsushi updated System.Xml.XLinq to use the new
	System.Query code.

<h3>Language Support</h3>

	<p>Support for third party languages like IronPython and Boo
	has improved in this release.   Users of those languages are
	strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release.

<h3>SSL/TLS</h3>

	<p>Added support for abbreviated handshakes, which will reuse
	a previous security parameters, to re-establish a secure
	connection (Sebastien).

	<p>Fixed some possible deadlocks while negotiating (Gonzalo
	and Sebastien).

<h3>Libgdiplus</h3>

	<p>Sebastien has upgraded libgdiplus in various fronts:
	
	<p>Region operations: Added GdipCombineRegionPath function to allow using binary
	operations (union, intersection, complement, exclude and xor)
	on non-rectangular regions;
  
  	<p>Added GdipFlattenPath function (to convert curves into
  	lines);
	
	<p>Added support for region serialization (i.e. GdipGetRegionData, 
	GdipGetRegionDataSize and GdipCreateRegionRgnData functions);
  
  	<p>Better, but still not perfect, clipping support;

	<p>TextureBrush is now working again;

<h3>Ports: OSX/x86</h3>

	<p>Mono now supports OSX on Intel boxes.
	
	<p>Geoff and Paolo completed the port of Mono to OSX on x86
	processors.

<h3>System.Transactions</h3>

	<p>Ankit and Hari also worked on a basic implementation of
	System.Transactions.  The implementation uses a Lightweight
	Transaction Manager (LTM) allowing multiple volatile and/or a
	single durable resource manager.
	
<h3>Tools</h3>

	<p>The assembler and disassembler have been upgraded to
	support generics and they are now able to roundtrip all of our
	2.0 assemblies with generics (Ankit and Hari).

<h3>JIT Optimizations</h3>

	<p>Massimiliano's work on the tree mover, an optimization used
	to reduce the number of temporaries has been incorporated.

	<p>The tree mover allowed us to activate a number of
	optimizations on.  The new default optimizations now include
	inlining, dead code elimination, copy propagation and constant
	propagation.

	<p>For the release we did identify two small regressions
	related to inlining, so the code is not enabled by default as
	it regresses code that depends on GetCallingAssembly.

<h3>RelaxNG improvements</h3>

	<p>Significant RELAX NG improvements. There are a handful of bugfixes
	and performance improvements. Before those changes it is practically
	impossible to validate large XML documents. Now it can validate
	5 megabytes of OpenDocument specification document within a few
	seconds (on Pentium M 1.1GHz box), Atsushi.

<h3>Tools</h3>

	<p>A tiny utility "mono-xmltool" is added. It supports
	validation for XML Schema, DTD, RELAX NG and NVDL, as well as
	pretty printing and XSL transformation.

	<p>This tool is just a frontend for the various XML validation
	classes in Mono.

<h3>Encodings</h3>

	<p>I18N: Bruno Haible tried several tests on mono's Encoding support
	and it resulted in a bunch of bugfixes.

	<p>Also large amount of 2.0 profile support and optimization
	were done.
