<h1>Mono 1.1.8.1 Development Release</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.1.8.1 is a minor bug fix release to Mono 1.1.8, for
	details on 1.1.8 see its <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.8">release notes</a>.
	
<h3>Important Bug Fixes in 1.1.8.1</h3>

	<p>Fixed a bug in our Socket.Select implementation that was
	introduced in 1.1.8 which failed to work on write/error descriptors
	(Gonzalo).

	<p>Fixed a long-standing deadlock in the runtime.  This bug
	was only visible with heavy thread usage at startup on SMP
	systems but it would freeze certain applications (Beagle,
	iFolder and others).  The bug has been finally squashed (Ben,
	Gonzalo).

	<p>MacOS X and MonoPosixHelper: in Mono 1.1.8 we shipped a
	non-working Mono.Posix runtime for OSX users, this has been
	corrected (Geoff).

	<p>Support code generated by latest IKVM (Zoltan).

<h3>Extra Comppiler Support</h3>

	<p>Support for NPTL as the default threading system: this will
	benefit Gentoo and Fedora Core 4 users (Ben).
	
	<p>Workaround GCC 3.3 bugs (exposed on AMD64, but possibly
	other platforms) (Zoltan).
	
	<p>Support for GCC4 has been added for SUSE 9.3+ and Fedora
	Core 4 users (Ben).

	<p>Special thanks to Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.de> for
	his help.

<h3>Availability</h3>
