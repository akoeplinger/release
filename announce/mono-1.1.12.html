<a name="new"/></a>

<h2>What is new in Mono 1.1.12</h2>

<h3>Ports</h3>

	<p>Neale updated the S390 JIT compiler to match the new
	cross platform register allocator.

	<p>Paolo fixed a number PowerPC bugs that were exposed by new
	tests.  He also fixed floating point code generation on ARM.

<h3>IronPython</h3>

	<p>This version of Mono can run IronPython 0.9.6.
	
<h3>JIT Optimizations</h3>

	<p>An SSA-less Dead Code Elimination (fastdce) optimization
	was checked in by Massi.  This optimization will be more
	useful on the next release as we tune some of the
	optimizations that produce dead code.
	
<h3>Registry</h3>

	<p>An implementation of the registry is now available on
	Unix.  

<h3>2.0 profile updates.</h3>

	<p>TryParse methods are no longer wrappers for Parse, Parse is
	now implemented in terms of Parse which will give us the
	performance associated with TryParse (Carlos).

	<p>Implement the string compares from 2.0 (Atsushi).

	<p>Implemented System.Globalization and System.Text from 2.0
	as well as updating many of the CJK codecs (Atsushi).

	<p>Reflection updates from Zoltan.

	<p>Uri parsers from Sebastien.

	<p>System.XML 2.0: Most of 2.0 API has been fixed up except
	for Xml.Serialization have been done.  Atsushi continues to
	work on stabilizing the 2.0 API.

	<p>Ben added the initial support for the Nullable&lt;T&gt;
        boxing conventions.  These implement the last-minute changes
        that went into the Nullable&lt;T&gt; in .NET.  It is known to
        have some bugs, as well as incomplete support in parts of the
        runtime.

	<p>Chris Toshok continues to work on the 2.0
	System.Configuration assembly which is a key component of many
	of the new ASP.NET classes.

	<p>Dick implemented the 2.0 Semaphore classes (named and
	unnamed). 
	
<h3>Debugger</h3>

	<p>The Debugger works for the first time.   It might still be
	a  bit flaky, but I have been using it.

	<p>Get it from: <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/sources/mono-debugger/mono-debugger-0.11.tar.gz">here</a>.

	<p>The X-Develop 1.2 beta has GUI support for it as well.

<h3>Text Encoding</h3>

	<p>Atsushi implemented the 2.x support for text encodings: the
	new unmanaged APIs and the fallback code.  
	
<h3>SharpZipLib upgraded</h3>

	<p>We have upgraded SharpZipLib to the latest version,
	required to run the new IKVM. 

<h3>Monodoc</h3>

	<p>Improved the Web UI, based on code from Eric Butler.

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>Windows.Forms is moving into bug fixing mode.  We need as
	many people as possible testing their Windows.Forms
	applications and submit bug reports for any issues found with
	it.

	<p>These are some of the highlights, as Windows.Forms is the
	piece that changed the most in this release:

	<p>Alexander updates his "Nice" theme.  He also checked in a
	new theme "ClearLooks".  Set the variable MONO_THEME to "nice"
	or "clearlooks" to select these themes.

	<p>Jackson added MDI and toolwindow support, improved the
	TreeView and ListView widgets.

	<p>Mike improved the Menu infrastructure and introduced
	shortcut and key navigation support into Windows.Forms

	<p>Pedro contributed some updates to his summer of code
	DataGridView widget.

	<p>Peter added cut and paste support to the Textbox and
	RichTextBox widgets, keybindings for it, drag and drop and
	undo support.

<h3>HttpListener</h3>

	<p>Gonzalo implemented the embeddable HttpListener web
	server.  Very cute.

<h3>System.Drawing</h3>

	<p>Jordi has upgraded our System.Drawing stack to implement
	the 2.0 API.

	<p>Jonathan Gilbert fixed an important bug in GDI+ that
	prevented some applications from running correctly
	(UnlockBitmap was busted).

<h3>Compilers</h3>

	<p>Ankit continues to improve the assembler and disassembler
	to support generics and has updated the PEAPI accordingly.

	<p> Harinath Raja, Marek Safar and Martin Baulig and continued
	to fix bugs in the C# compiler and improve the error and
	warning reporting of the compiler.
	
	<p>Basic compiler: Many bug fixes and improvements from
	Alexandre Rocha, Jelmer Vernooij and Maverson Eduardo.

	<p>Atsushi fixed many bugs in the -doc: command line handling
	in the C# compiler.

	<p>Cesar continued to improve the JScript compiler, the
	Mozilla test suite now at 8577 successful tests out of 8866
	(96.74%).

<h3>IO Layer</h3>

	<p>Dick did various improvements to the IO-layer: threads were
	moved back into the shared handle space now that the leak bug
	is gone.

	<p>The main thread will now dispose all of its resources upon
	termination.

	<p>ShellExecute will now work properly on Windows.

<h3>Npgsql</h3>

	<p>Francisco upgraded Npgsql database driver to 1.0beta1.

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

	<p>Many bug fixes and tests everywhere.  In particular CodeDOM
	got a large test harness by Gert, many bug fixes by Gonzalo to
	System.Web.   Gamin is now correctly autodetected for the
	FileSystemWatcher. 

	<p>Special thanks go to Robert Jordan which provided plenty of
	bug fixes and bug reports for this release of Mono.  We also
	want to thank Zoltan which continues to fix bugs everywhere in
	the runtime.

	<p>John Luke updated and fixed various Mono.Cairo binding
	issues.

	<p>Jonathan Pryor updated the Mono.Unix namespace extensively.

	<p>Senganal is the new maintainer of System.Data and has been
	fixing many of the System.Data bugs.
