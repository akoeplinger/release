<h1>New in Mono 1.2.3</h1>

	<p>This release contains major improvements to ASP.NET 2.0 and
	Windows.Forms as well as many bug fixes to the C# compiler and
	runtime libraries. Developers and users are encouraged to
	upgrade to this release.

	<p>Stats:
	<ul>
		<li>1,933 missing methods were implemented.
		<li>164 methods with pending implementations were fixed.
	</ul>
	
	<p>This is the first release to ship the new Visual Basic
	compiler from Rolf Bjarne, see below for details.

	<p>This release ships an API complete ASP.NET 2.0 
	implementation (except for WebParts). 
	
	<p>This release also includes a critical fixes to the runtime
	startup.  Heavily multi-threaded applications would have
	crashed otherwise.

	<p>Windows.Forms has had over 115 bugs fixed. 

	<p>In this release, we are now shipping the <a href="http://fepy.sourceforge.net/">IronPython
	Community Edition</a> (IPCE) from Seo Sanghyeon.   IPCE
	includes a number of preconfigured  libraries with IronPython
	to improve your IronPython developing experience. 

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>TableLayout control (2.0) [Jonathan Pobst]

	<p>Significant updates to the 2.0 API (including most of the
	*Strip classes) [Chris Toshok, Andreia Gaita, Jackson Harper,
	Jonathan Pobst, Carlos Cort√©s, Daniel Nauck].
	
	<p>SendKeys (1.1) has been implemented [Andreia Gaita]

	<p>ListViewGroups, Autocompletion [Daniel Nauck]

	<p>Many performance optimizations have been implemented:
	reduced buffers used for double buffering, reduced memory
	usage by using standard event practices (use EventHandlerList
	instead of compiler provider events).
	
<h3>Visual Basic</h3>

	<p>This is the first release of Mono that includes the
	self-hosting Visual Basic environment.   This is a
	<i>preview</i> of the Basic support, we will be releasing this
	officially at a later date.

	<p>The source code is available on a separate download
	(mono-basic package).

	<p>The environment includes Rolf Bjarne's Visual Basic 8
	compiler written in Visual Basic 8, and Mainsoft's Visual
	Basic runtime for 2.0.  The compiler only targets the 2.0
	framework API, the  runtime supports both 1.0 and 2.0
	profiles. 
	
<h3>ASP.NET</h3>

	<p>From Mainsoft: numberous bug fixes and improvements to the
	ASP.NET implementation.    ASP.NET 2.0 is now control-complete
	(with the exception of WebParts).

	<p>During the development of the 2.0 support hundreds of bugs
	have been fixed, and a number of key applications have been
	ported to test the 2.0 support.

	<p>Mainsoft has ported the starter kits from www.asp.net with
	their Grasshopper toolchain: Personal Web Site, Club site,
	Small business, Classifieds and Time Tracker.   These have not
	been tested directly with Mono yet. 
	
	<p>From Marek Habersack:

	<ul>
		<li>Tag Mapping (the &lt;tagMapping&gt; in config files).

		<li>2.0 Session State Model.

		<li>Support for 2.0 ProfileCommon custom profile
		class, generated from profile properties listed in
		Web.config

		<li>Correct and full implementation of the
		App_Local/GlobalResources folders.

	</ul>

	<p>From Damien Churchill:

	<ul>
		<li>Application auto-restart after changes to
		App_Code, App_{Local,Global}Resources are detected
		(code by Damien Churchill)
	</ul>

	<p>There is still a lot of work to do to improve the quality
	and performance of the ASP.NET 2.0 implementation, testers are
	welcomed. 

	<p>The current status of ASP.NET 2.0 features is tracked <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/ASPTests">here</a>.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

	<p>Monodoc now is shipping stub documentation for the 2.0
	APIs [Jonathan Pryor].

<h3>Security</h3>

	(e.g. debug information, installers) and for file length that aren't 
	multiple of eight [Sebastien Pouliot].

	using the MONO_TLS_SESSION_CACHE_TIMEOUT environment variable

	the supporting runtime) is now able to build projects and it
	can now parse all of the msbuild project definitions
	(VS2005).

	<p>Work remains in two areas: improving the API support for
	MonoDevelop to use, and add batch support.

	<p>Details about xbuild are available <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Microsoft.Build">here</a>. 
	
<h3>Sqlite Provider</h3>

	<p>Optimizations: Multi-array access has been hand tuned in
	the JIT; constant initialization and block initializations are
	now handled by the JIT;  [Paolo Molaro].
	
	<p>Support for SafeHandles has been added to Mono, for full
	details about what is supported see <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/SafeHandles">the
	safehandles</a> page on the Mono Web Site [Miguel].

	<p>Header files for Mono are now versioned, this is in
	preparation for having multiple runtime SDKs installed
	side-by-side [Paolo Molaro].

	<p>Optimized initialization of arrays (30% to 100% increase
	depending on the array size) and access to multi-dimentional
	arrays (4 times faster for three dimensional arrays) [Paolo
	Molaro].

	updated.

	<p>The SPARC port is now three times as fast (Zoltan Varga).

<h3>Console</h3>

	<p>The 2.0 console is now lazily initialized, this means that
	the overhead of switching from the standard console to
	emulating a full-screen console will only happen if the new
	2.0 features are used [Gonzalo Paniagua].
