Release Notes for Mono, Gtk# and XSP Combined Windows Installer. 
Code name: "About Time"
By Wade Berrier <wberrier@novell.com> September 29, 2005
------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Description:

This installation includes Mono 1.1.9.1 for Windows and the Gtk# 1.0.10 
and 2.3.91 for Windows.  It also includes a built and configured version 
of XSP 1.1.9.1.


New in this Release:

Boo and ikvm are now included.

The build system for the installer has been revamped.  Because of this,
upcoming versions will be released very shortly after Mono releases.
Although much time has been spent to ensure a quality build, there
may be some growing pains because of the new build system.

Requirements:

This build runs on Windows 2000 or later.

Known Issues:

-The monodoc browser (Mono-tools) was not included in this release
 because mono-tools doesn't build on windows yet.  Hopefully this
 will change. 
-Some of the precompiled samples don't work because they
 depend on gtk# 1.9.5.  The samples have been included in order to 
 look at the source code. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.
-Gtk# 2.3.91 normally includes documentation.  This build does not.
