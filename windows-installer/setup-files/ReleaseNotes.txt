------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check http://go-mono.com/archive/1.1.10/ for release details.

General Description:

This installation includes Mono 1.1.10 for Windows and the Gtk# 1.0.10 
and 2.4.0 for Windows.  It also includes a built and configured version 
of XSP 1.1.10.

New in this Release:

-gtk-wimp theme now the default.  The old Default theme was renamed to
 'Raleigh'.

Requirements:

This build runs on Windows 2000 or later.

Known Issues:

-The monodoc browser (Mono-tools) was not included in this release
 because mono-tools doesn't build on windows yet.  Hopefully this
 will change. 
-Some of the precompiled samples don't work because they
 depend on gtk# 1.9.5.  The samples have been included in order to 
 look at the source code. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.
