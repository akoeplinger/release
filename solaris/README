Build scripts for Mono and libgdiplus, on OpenSolaris and Solaris x86 and SPARC.




QUICK REFERENCE
---------------

On Solaris (not needed for OpenSolaris), ensure we're using Gnu tar, Gnu make
and Gnu patch:
$ PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:$PATH



On all platforms:
$ tar xjf mono-X.Y.Z-tar.bz2
$ cd mono-X.Y.Z
$ patch -p1 < ../solaris-sgen-2.10.diffs (if needed!)
$ sh ../mono-pkg

Now go and have lunch.  If the build succeeded the solaris package is
/tmp/mono.pkg.gz.  If the build failed, it will most likely be a mono build
issue that will need solving on a case-by-case basis.

Building libgdiplus is similar, just substitute libgdiplus-pkg for mono-pkg
above.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

OpenSolaris

The distribution comes with everything you need to build mono, but you may
need to use the package manager to install additional build requirements.


Solaris

You're going to need to download a bunch of packages from
http://www.sunfreeware.com

On my Solaris 10 x86 machine I installed:

curl-7.21.1
expat-2.0.1
gdb-6.8
git-1.7.2
grep-2.7
libgcc-3.4.6
libiconv-1.13.1
libidn-1.19
libintl-3.4.0
libssh2-1.2.7
libungif-4.1.4
lsof_0508-4.80
make-3.82
ncurses-5.7
openssl-1.0.0a
patch-2.6
pcre-8.10
tar-1.23
zlib-1.2.5


Solaris/x86 also requires a newer version of the Boehm GC library from
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/.  I used gc-7.1.tar.gz.  The
build script expects it to be installed in /opt/libgc.
