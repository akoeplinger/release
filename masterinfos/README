How to build all masterinfos
===============================
The Makefile in this directory is intended to help building the masterinfos on
windows under cygwin. To build them:

1. Edit the Makefile and update it to your paths.

2. Copy assemblies-list.txt, createinfos.sh, Makefile to a directory, say,
'lalala'. Ensure createinfos.sh has +x permissions.

3. Copy mono-api-info.cs from SVN (mcs/tools/corcompare) to 'lalala'.

4. make infos

You'll get a 1.1 and a 2.0 directory with the .xml files.
