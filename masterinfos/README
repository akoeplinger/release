How to build all masterinfos
===============================

	The Makefile in this directory is intended to help building
	the masterinfos on windows under cygwin. To build them:
	
	1. Edit the Makefile and update it to your paths.
	
	2. Copy assemblies-list*.txt, createinfos.sh, Makefile to a
	directory, say, 'lalala'. Ensure createinfos.sh has +x
	permissions.
	
	3. Copy mono-api-info.cs from SVN (mcs/tools/corcompare) to
	'lalala'.
	
	4. make infos
	
	You'll get a 1.1 and a 2.0 directory with the .xml files.


Updating masterinfos for the buildbot
=====================================

	Log into root@mono.ximian.com and go into the directory

	/var/www/mono-website/go-mono/masterinfos

	Download the new masterinfos with the full build name 
	and link it to the appropriate file, for instance, for
	the 2.x profile use:

		masterinfos-2.0.tar.gz

	Trigger a rebuild on Buildbot.

	Currently we use the x86 machine for updating the status pages.
