<h1>Join the Mono Project for the GHOP Contest!</h1>

	<p>The Mono Project is participating in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/">Highly Open 
	Participation (GHOP) Contest</a>. If you're a pre-university student over the age of 13, check out 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/list">our task list</a> and claim a 
	task. If you successfully complete it you'll win a t-shirt and a certificate, and for every three tasks you complete 
	you'll win $100, up to a maximum of $500. The most successful students will win a trip to Google's Headquarters in 
	Mountain View, CA!</p>
	
	<p>This is a fantastic opportunity to join an open source community, help people, and get rewarded for it. It's not limited 
	to coding; you can write documentation, translate an application, or even create icons. Applications built with Mono such 
	as <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee</a> and <a href="http://f-spot.org">F-Spot</a> are taking part too.</p>
	
	<p>If you have any questions, hop onto <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/IRC">IRC</a> or email our 
	<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mailing_Lists">mailing lists</a> and we'll do our best to help you. All community 
	members are welcome to help out guiding students and suggesting new tasks.</p>
