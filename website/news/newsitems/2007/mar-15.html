<h1>Google Summer of Code</h1>

	<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of
	Code</a> has started.   Students interested in participating
	in the Summer of Code need to submit their applications in the
	next ten days.

	<p>Some ideas of interesting things that can be done with Mono
	are available in our <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects">Student
	Projects</a> page. 

	<p>If you think that you have a good idea for a project to be
	implemented for Mono, but is not listed on that page, feel
	free to submit your idea.

	<p>We are looking at improving Mono's OSX support (Winforms,
	debugger support, improving Cocoa#); new ports and improving
	existing Mono ports; Profiling; low-level optimizations; New
	Windows.Forms widgets; Work on 3.0 components and libraries;
	Improving MonoDevelop and creating new C# class libraries for
	Mono.

	<p><b>Important:</b> Time is short, only ten days left for
	applying to the Summer of Code.
