<p>We are in the process of putting together an agenda for the 2007 Mono
Summit in Madrid.  If you are a contributor or user of Mono, and are
interested in presenting, demoing or being involved in the summit in any
way, please send <a href="mailto:jackson@ximian.com">Jackson</a> an
email with your proposal.

<p>Please include in your proposal a topic, description, and your desired
presentation format (ie a Talk, Birds of a Feather, Company Sponsored
outing, or just a brief demo).  We will also need to know the length of
time you will need for your presentation.
