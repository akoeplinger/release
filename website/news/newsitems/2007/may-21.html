<h1>Team Foundation for Mono</h1>

	<p>Joel Reed has released <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/tf4mono/">Team Foundation for
	Mono</a> an implementation of the Team Foundation libraries
	and related client programs for the .Net platform. Team
	Foundation is a 'collection of collaborative technologies that
	support a team effort to deliver a product' from Microsoft
	that includes bug tracking, source control, and other
	capabilities.

	<p>This project focuses currently on the SCM related libraries
	and tools. It includes a fairly functional version of the TF
	client used to access the SCM capabilities of Team Foundation
	servers. In some respects, its usability exceeds that of the
	standard TF tool. It also includes some subcommands from the
	TF Power Tool, and leverages the Gnome Keyring when
	available. Team Foundation does not do file attribute
	tracking, but the included TF client in this project leverages
	libmagic to implement file attribute tracking on unix
	platforms.

	<p>Team Foundation is tightly integrated into the Visual
	Studio platform. This project will hopefully someday include a
	MonoDevelop plugin as well as implementations of the other
	non-SCM related Team Foundation libraries.

	<p>For registered developers, CodePlex is a publicly
	accessible example of a Team Foundation server used to host
	open source projects.
