<h1>Mono Bugzilla Migration</h1>

	<p>This Saturday morning (September 15th) at 8am MDT we will
	be doing our final migration to the Novell Bugzilla system. Although
	we expect this migration to take much less time, we have planned a
	http://bugzilla.ximian.com outage until Monday (September 17th) at
	8am.  During the outage, http://bugzilla.ximian.com will not be
	accessible.

	<p>Once the migration is complete, http://bugzilla.novell.com will be the
	official Mono Bugzilla. In preparation for the switch, please create a
	Novell.Com account by going to the following URL.

	Login Creation Page</a>.

	<p>It is important that you use the same e-mail address for
	this account that you use on http://bugzilla.ximian.com.
