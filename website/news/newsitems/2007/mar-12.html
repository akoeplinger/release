<h1>Nokia 770 and Nokia 800 Packages Available</h1>

	<p>Mono packages for the Nokia 770 and Nokia 800 are now
	available from our <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Maemo">Maemo</a> page.

	<p>We are providing a single-click install for users of
	Maemo.   The package split will allow developers to only
	install the components that they need to run their software.

	<p>New updates to Mono will be automatically available on your
	Nokia device as well.
	
	<p>For example, by installing the sample editor application,
	you will pull Mono and Gtk#, otherwise only the core Mono
	runtime will be installed.
