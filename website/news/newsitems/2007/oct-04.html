<h1>The opening of the .NET Source Code from Microsoft</h1>

	<p>Miguel de Icaza has written a <a
	href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Oct-03.html">statement
	on Mono's position to the opening of the .NET source code</a>.

	<p>Since the source code release from Microsoft later this
	year will not be open source, this code will have no impact on
	Mono's schedule as it will not be able to use any of the
	information included in this code. 
	
	<p>Mono's policy on contributions continues to be the same
	that we have had over the years: if you have seen Microsoft
	.NET source code in any shape or form (soure code,
	decompilers, through NDAs or research licenses), you will not
	be able to contribute patches to the Mono implementation.

	<p>For more details about Mono's policies, see <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing">our
	contributing page</a>.
