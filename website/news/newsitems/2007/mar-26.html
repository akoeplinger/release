<h1>Mono.AddIn</h1>

	<p>Lluis just announced Mono.Addins:

	<p>Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible
	applications, and for creating libraries which extend those
	applications.

	<p>Mono.Addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful
	for a wide range of applications: from simple applications
	with small extensibility needs, to complex applications which
	need support for large add-in structures.

	<p>This new framework intends to set an standard for building
	extensible applications and add-ins in Mono. 

	<p>The main features of Mono.Addins are:

	<ul>
	   <li> Supports descriptions of add-ins using custom attributes (for
	        simple and common extensions) or using an xml manifest (for more
	        complex extensibility needs). 
	   <li> Support for add-in hierarchies, where add-ins may depend on
	        other add-ins. 
	   <li> Lazy loading of add-ins. 
	   <li> Provides an API for accessing to add-in descriptions, which will
	        allow building development and documentation tools for handling
	        add-ins. 
	   <li> Dynamic activation / deactivation of add-ins at run time. 
	   <li> Allows sharing add-in registries between applications, and
	        defining arbitrary add-in locations. 
	   <li> Allows implementing extensible libraries. 
	   <li> In addition to the basic add-in engine, it provides a Setup
	        library to be used by applications which want to offer basic
	        add-in management features to users, such as enabling/disabling
	        add-ins, or installing add-ins from on-line repositories.
	</ul>
