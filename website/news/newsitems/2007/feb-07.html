	<p>Thanks to everyone using <a

	submitting their reports, we were able to prioritize the work
	needed to get applications running.  The top used <b>1,933
	APIs</b> have been implemented in this release as well as many
	bugs fixed and performance increased.

	<p>New Moma definition files.   If you are using Moma to
	evaluate porting your software, running it again will load the
	new API definitions.

	<p>Mono debuts Rolf Bjarne's <b>Visual Basic 8.0 compiler</b>
	written completely in Visual Basic 8.   We are also shipping
	Seo Sanghyeon's <a

	Edition</a>.

	<p>Some highlights: ASP.NET 2.0 is almost complete (WebParts
	are still missing), a new System.Media implementation is
	included, SOAP 1.2 is now supported, HttpListener does
	TLS/SSL, 2.0 System.Net.Sockets is available, many
	Windows.Forms API fixes and improvements, improved startup
	time, more ports and much ADO.NET 2.0 work.
