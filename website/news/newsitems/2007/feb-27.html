<h1>Medsphere Goes Open Source</h1>

	<p><a href="http://www.medsphere.com">Medsphere</a> has <a
	href="http://medsphere.org/">open sourced</a> their OpenVista
	software.  They have launched a <a
	href="http://medpshere.org">site</a> for their open source
	efforts.

	<p>The medical community can now rejoice!

	<p>OpenVista is written in C# using Gtk# and runs on Linux and
	Windows.  It is a great sample of a commercial application
	that started on Linux with C# and Gtk# and was later ported to
	Windows.
