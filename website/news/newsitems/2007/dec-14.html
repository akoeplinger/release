<h1>MoMA 1.2.6 Changes</h1>

	<p>We have released the new version of MoMA which corresponds
	with the 1.2.6 release of Mono.  There are two very important
	changes that are worth mentioning about this new version.</p>
	
	<p><b>- Addition of .Net 3.0/3.5 Classes -</b> Beginning with
	1.2.6, we include the definitions needed to scan your .Net 3.0
	and 3.5 apps.  At this point, we report everything as missing.
	Even though we have implemented some of these classes in
	our <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Olive">Olive
	project</a>, we do not currently ship this with the released
	Mono, and MoMA tracks the Mono releases.</p>
	
	<p>So what good is adding the 3.0/3.5 stuffs if we are going
	to report it all as missing?  We will soon be getting to the
	point where we need to figure out what new stuff to implement
	next.  By scanning your app with MoMA and submitting the
	missing report, we can see which parts are the most important
	to our users so we can prioritize.  (And yes, we _really_ use
	this
	data.  <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/momareports/">MoMA
	reports</a> have pretty much dictated our prioritization since
	it was released a year ago.)</p>
	
	<p><b>- Removal of Design Namespaces -</b> One of our
	awesome <a href="http://www.beyondfocus.com/Default.aspx?pageid=-1">mono-vangelists</a>
	pointed out that people scan their app (and third party
	controls) and see all kinds of warnings about things missing
	in the Design classes.  However, these classes are not used to
	run apps, just for designers such as Visual Studio.  So we are
	potentially scaring off users for no reason.  Therefore,
	beginning with 1.2.6, we no longer include the Design
	namespaces in MoMA reports.  (If you really want the Design
	stuffs, you can download the definition file that includes
	them on the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MoMA">MoMA
	home page</a>.)</p>
	
	<p><b>- How Do I Get These New Features? -</b> The new class
	definitions could not be handled by existing version of MoMA,
	so you will need to download a new version of MoMA, which is
	available on the MoMA
	homepage: <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MoMA">http://www.mono-project.com/MoMA</a>.</p>
