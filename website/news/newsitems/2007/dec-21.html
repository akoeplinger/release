<h1>Graffiti to run on Mono</h1>

	<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/">Rob Howard</a>
	today <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2007/12/21/graffiti-will-run-on-mono.aspx">announced</a>
	that their <a href="http://graffiticms.com/">Graffiti</a>
	product will run on top of Mono, and the platforms supported
	by Mono:

	<blockquote><i>

	Early this week we announced that VistaDB will be the database
	that Graffiti uses by default. You will be able to use other
	databases (SQL Server and MySQL) too, but we liked VistaDB for
	a variety of reasons. One of which we're officially announcing
	today:

	<p>Graffiti is going to run on Mono.

	<p>There are a variety of reasons why adding Mono support
	makes sense. But the biggest reason is choice. It gives people
	more choices for how they want to use Graffiti.

	<p>By supporting Mono, in addition to Microsoft .NET, Graffiti
	will be available on the following platforms:

	<p>Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Unix

	<p>We're not there yet, but we've been working with some folks
	on the Mono team to make the necessary changes in Graffiti to
	run on Mono. Everyday we get a little closer, but we're far
	enough along now that we're ready to start talking about it.

	</i></blockquote>

	<p>Of course, having someone
	like <a href="http://telligent.com/">Telligent</a> making this
	announcement has made all of us very happy.  We look forward
	to their product launch.

	intro</a> about what Graffiti is.
