<h1>Mainsoft Releases Grasshopper 2.0 Preview</h1>

	<p>Mainsoft has released a <a
	href="http://dev.mainsoft.com/Default.aspx?tabid=236">preview
	of their 2.0 Grasshopper product</a>.

	<p>Grasshopper allows server-side .NET applications to run in
	a J2EE server.  This is done by recompiling the CIL bytecodes
	into JVM bytecodes and providing a Mono-based set of class
	libraries for the applications to run.

	<p>Major new features in this new release include ASP.NET 2.0
	support and Visual Studio based debugging.
