<h1>MonoDevelop 0.13 has been released</h1>

	<p>MonoDevelop 0.13 has been <a
	href="http://www.monodevelop.com/Release_notes_for_MonoDevelop_0.13">released</a>.

	<p>See the <a
	href="http://www.monodevelop.com/Release_notes_for_MonoDevelop_0.13">release
	notes</a> for full details and screenshots. 

	<p>This version features:

	<ul>
		<li>Version Control support (Subversion only
		currently), supports adding, removing, moving,
		check-out, check-in, ChangeLogs and patch review.
		
		<li>Much improved Code Completion, Visual Studio like
		templates.
		
		<li>Task View.
		
		<li>Support for Web References (Generate stubds from
		WSDL contracts from the IDE).
	</ul>

	<p>Gtk# Designer improvements:

	<ul>
		<li>Use of partial classes to separate user code from
		generated code, this means that it is no longer
		necessary to "Bind" manually every widget (this is
		optional, specially since not every language
		supports partial classes).

		<li>Undo/Redo are now available.

		<li>Internationalization support via Gettext. 

		<li>Absolute widget positioning is now possible with
		the Gtk.Fixed support (for those uncomfortable with
		the use of tables for GUI design).
	</ul>
	
	<p>Compilation Features:
	<ul>
		<li>Native support for Visual Studio 2005 solutions.
		<li>Custom commands for compilation.
		<li>Makefile integration (delegating operations to
		external makefiles, keep MonoDevelop in sync with Makefile
		sources, resources, dependencies).
		<li>Generic Prototype support: for adding support for
		other programming languages (compiling C libraries or
		compiling translations).
	</ul>

	<p>Other features:
	<ul>
		<li>Pressing F1 will load an external Monodoc for the
		current member highlighted.

		<li>Nunit 2.2.9 is now distributed with MonoDevelop
		(and integrated with it).
		
		<li>71 reported bugs fixed.

		<li>New deployment options allow external commands
		(build RPMs and DEBs for example).
	</ul>
