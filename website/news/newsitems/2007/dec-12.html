<h1>Mono 1.2.6 Released</h1>

	<p>We have just released Mono 1.2.6.   Some of the highlights
	for this release include:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Native Windows.Forms driver for MacOS X allows
		Winforms-based applications to run without an X
		server.

		<li>Support for the ASP.NET AJAX APIs and controls.

		<li>Support for FastCGI deployments: ASP.NET can now
		be deployed on a multitude of servers that implement
		the FastCGI protocol (lighttpd for example) in
		addition to Apache.

		<li>Windows.Forms now supports the WebControl on
		Windows and Linux using Mozilla.

		<li>Runtime will now consume much less memory for
		2.0-based applications due to various optimizations in
		generics support as well as including many new
		performance improvements and an updated verifier and
		an implementation of CoreCLR security.

		<li>C# compiler is quickly approaching full 3.0
		support, most of the basics work right now (except
		support for System.Query.Expression AST generation). 

		<li>Mono 1.2.6 can now be used as an SDK for creating
		Silverlight 1.1 applications on all platforms.   This
		allows developers to create applications that target
		Silverlight without requiring a Windows installation. 

	</ul>
