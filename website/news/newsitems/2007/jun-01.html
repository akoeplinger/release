	Summer of Code Podcast</a> that we did a few weeks ago.

	<blockquote><i>
	For our latest podcast, we caught up with some folks from the
	Mono Project. Miguel de Icaza, who among his many claims to
	fame is founder of the Mono Project and a Summer of Code
	mentor and organization administrator for 2005, 2006 & 2007,
	was joined by three former students for Mono: Aaron Tomb, Alan
	McGovern and Michael Hutchinson. Check out the podcast to
	learn more about Mono and the project's plans for SoC this
	year, as well as news on other Mono Summer of Code projects
	from 2005 & 2006. You'll also learn more about Aaron's work on
	defect detection for CIL bytecode, Alan's BitTorrent
	libraries, and Michael's creation of an ASP.NET project type
	for MonoDevelop.
