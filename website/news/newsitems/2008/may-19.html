<h1>Forums added to Mono Website</h1>

	<p>Web-based forums for Mono discussions have been added at 
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/forums">http://www.go-mono.com/forums</a>

	<p>Most active Mono community members participate in on-line discussions 
	through our mailing lists; however, many Mono users have expressed a 
	preference for web forums based discussions.

	<p>In order to address this demand for an official forums for Mono, 
	while keeping the community engaged in our mailing lists, we have 
	embedded <a href="http://www.nabble.com">nabble.com</a> into our 
	site to create a bridge between the two groups.  So, you can now use 
	whichever method you prefer participate in the community.
