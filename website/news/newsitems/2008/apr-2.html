<h1>Mono 1.9 Released</h1>

	<p>Slightly delayed news, a few weeks ago we released our best
	Mono release so
	far: <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.9">Mono
	1.9</a>, the last release before Mono reaches its 2.0 level.

	<p>Mono 1.9 is considered a stable release and should be
	considered the new stable version to be shipped.   It should
	replace older versions of Mono 1.2

	<p>You can obtain this
	from <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">the
	downloads page</a>.
