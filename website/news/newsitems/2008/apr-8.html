<h1>Mono C# Compiler Under MIT X11 License</h1>

	<p>Starting with version 2.0 of Mono, the Mono C# compiler
	source code will also be available under the MIT X11 license.

	<p>We are changing the license to allow parts of the compiler
	to be reused as part of MonoDevelop, our LINQ class libraries
	and to embed it in ASP.NET.

	<p><b>In MonoDevelop:</b> This will allow the compiler to be
	used to improve code-completion to support C# 3.0 as well as
	improving the heuristics when offering completions.   This
	will reuse the front end and parts of the backend.

	<p><b>Compiler hosting inside ASP.NET:</b> This will embed the
	whole compiler into the ASP.NET process, eliminating about one
	second for each compilation of a piece of code.   In the past,
	for each request for an uncompiled resource, we would have to
	call the compiler, wait for its output and then load the
	output.   This typically shaves between 0.7 to 1 second on
	those scenarios, ideal to improve the developer experience.

	<p><b>LINQ Class Libraries:</b> This will allow us to reuse
	parts of the compiler in our System.Core implementation for
	LINQ for the current 3.5 generation and upcoming generations.
	Many corner cases are handled by the compiler, and we will now
	be able to lift those pieces.   This will mostly use the
	backend of the compiler.
