	<p><a href="http://www.entityspaces.net">EntitySpaces</a> has
	<a href="http://www.entityspaces.net/blog/2008/02/03/EntitySpaces1000MonoContestWeHaveAWinner.aspx">announced
	a winner</a> for their contest
	to <a href="http://www.entityspaces.net/blog/2007/12/06/EntitySpaces1000ContestForAMonoApplication.aspx">write
	an application to run on Linux with Mono</a>.

	<p>From their announcement:

	<blockquote>
	If you are an EntitySpaces customer, you can now travel
	anywhere. From Windows, to Mono/Linux solutions, to the
	Compact Framework and all kinds of wireless devices, to Web
	Applications including "Medium Trust" support, or to high-end
	Enterprise Applications, EntitySpaces can take you
	there. EntitySpaces is truly a tiny, lightweight, powerful
	architecture for the Microsoft.NET Framework, and uses zero
	reflection. If you are a Mono developer, EntitySpaces is a
	terrific architecture for you. With it, you can work on both
	sides of the isle. Our database independence can free you from
	most of the complexities of supporting many types of
	databases, including those that run under Mono, such as MySQL
	and VistaDB. No longer will you have to invent new
	architectures with every new challenge that comes down the
	road.

	<p>Our contest winner goes by the title Pro.Coder, and is a
	independent contractor. We have received his entry to our Mono
	contest, and were quite pleased. Pro.Coder sent us a DVD with
	the EntitySpaces demo running under Mono. Thank you Pro.Coder,
	you did an excellent
	job. An <a href="http://www.entityspaces.net/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/EntitySpaces1000MonoContestWehaveaWinner_141D7/image_thumb.png">image
	of it is shown</a> below. Pro.Coder added the CRUD and
	DynamicQuery Join examples, to satisfy our contest
	requirements.

	for details on how Pro.Coder got started with Mono.  It
	details what they downloaded (EntitySpaces, Mono, MySQL
	connector, VMWare Player, Mono VMware image), which versions
	of the software they used, how they imported the database and
	how they were able to deliver the application.
