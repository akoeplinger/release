<h1>Packaged .NET Software for Linux</h1>

	<p>As part of the QA process for Mono, our fabulous QA team
	has been packaging various popular open source .NET
	applications, Gnome, Gtk#, ASP.NET, libraries and
	Windows.Forms in an easy-to-install fashion for various
	Linux distributions.

	<p>We are using
	the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service">OpenSUSE
	Build Service</a> to make the software available for various
	Linux distributions.

	<p>Our repository is
	available <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Mono:/Community/">here<a>,
	for instructions on how to add the repository
	see <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/User">the
	user manual</a>.
