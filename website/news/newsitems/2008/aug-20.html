<h1>SecondLife Launches Mono-based servers</h1>

	<p>Jim Purbrick (Babbage) from Linden Labs has announced on
	the SecondLife Blog
	that <a href="http://blog.secondlife.com/2008/08/20/mono-launch/">they
	have started the rollout of their Mono-enabled servers</a>.

	<p>They are using Mono as an engine that accelerates the
	execution of user provided scripts by translating LSL scripts
	into ECMA CIL bytecodes and in turn letting Mono turn that
	into x86 machine code.
