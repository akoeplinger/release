<h1>MonoDevelop 1.0 has been Released</h1>

	<p>After a few years in the oven, we are ready to announce the
	first release of MonoDevelop.   Lluis has put together a set
	of <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/MonoDevelop_1.0_Released">in-depth

	MonoDevelop and links to various tutorials and screencasts as
