<h2>Apr 20, 2004: S390 port; Interpreted Updated;  Identity classes;  System.Drawing; Mono Debugger.</h2>

	Neale who originally wrote the S390 interpreter support for
	Mono has checked into CVS his port of the S390 JIT engine.
	Now, if we could only have one of those in our living room.

	Bernie has checked into CVS a new interpreter for the Mono
	runtime.  This new interpreter translates the CIL opcodes into
	a new intermediate representation.  The new IL representation
	avoids doing costly lookups during interpretation which means that the
	interpreter is a lot faster now.

	Performance wise, the new interpreter is three times faster
	than the old one when doing a compiler bootstrap.

	Sebastien has recently completed the identity classes in the
	Mono Runtime, you can see more details on his <a
	href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">blog</a>

	New progress on the GDI+ front: Jordi has completed the region
	code; Ravindra the various brushes that we must support;
	Sanjay the Icon and BMP loaders (with Mark) and Vladimir has
	contributed various codecs and a new fresh implementation of
	Image.LockBits.

	Lluis and Atsushi in the meantime has been in charge of
	completing various pending items from our class libraries:
	basically an API audit of the things missing for the Mono 1.0
	release, small but important things.

	Martin has replaced the old command-line language in the
	debugger with our home-grown "Command Line" language, a
	TCL-like command line language that we built for it (its a
	tiny .NETized Tcl-like language).  The interaction process is
	a lot smoother than it used to be and we are focusing on the
	usability of the command line language to improve the
	debugging experience.

<h2>Apr 02, 2004: Mono C# Compiler gets CLS support;   Basic Runtime Contribution from Mainsoft.</h2>

	Marek Safar has been working for a few months on adding
	support to the C# compiler to support the various checks required
	by the Common Language Specification (CLS).

	In the past the C# compiler was unable to flag any problems
	related to the creation of cross-language libraries.  Today
	with this patch the compiler will properly flag errors in CLS
	compliance.  Tests for all of the errors have also been
	included on CVS.

	<a href="http://www.mainsoft.com">Mainsoft</a> has contributed
	an implementation of their Basic runtime to the project.  The
	runtime they wrote is written in Java and we are translating
	this into C# code.  The code will reach CVS within the next
	few weeks.

	Mainsoft also contributed an extensive regression test suite
	for the Basic runtime, a port of the NIST XML tests and their
	own in-house developed XML tests. 

<h2>Mar 31st, 2004: Gtk# 0.18, MonoDoc 0.13, MonoDevelop 0.2 released</h2>

<h2>Mar 15th, 2004: Async IO lands on Mono.</h2>

	Gonzalo has completed the implementation of Async I/O for Mono
	using the kernel aio_* interfaces.  If your operating system supports
	the aio_ POSIX interface, the FileStream methods that
	expose asynchronous methods will use this facility instead of
	emulating it with threads as we have done in the past.

	We had this request come to us from various people in the
	past, and we are now looking for your help to test and debug
	this.
