@mDnsResponder.Net;  Global Assembly Cache.

	Brady Anderson has released the first version of his <a href=
	"http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?mdnsresponder">multicast
	DNS responder</a> written in C# for the Mono and .NET
	platforms.  This is the foundation for implementing
	rendezvous-like functionality in your applications.

	The tree has started to stabilize after all the changes last
	week to integrate the Global Assembly Cache work that Jackson,
	Sebastien, Todd and all the volunteers helped us deploy.
