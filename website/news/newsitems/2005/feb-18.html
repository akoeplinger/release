<h1>DB4 Objects, Installers</h1>

	<p>The db4objects database system is now available for Mono,
	for more information see <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/db4o.html">db4o</a>
	documentation on the Mono site.

	<p> db4o is a non-intrusive persistence system that stores any
	complex object with one single line of code. The class schema
	of your application classes is analysed and adjusted in real
	time when objects are stored. Querying functionality is
	provided through Query-By-Example and with the
	S.O.D.A. querying API. High performance is achieved with
	indexed fields and by reducing database-file-internal
	redirections to the absolute minimum. db4o features ACID
	transactions, fast embedded single-user mode and
	multi-transactional Client/Server access, locally and through
	TCP.

	<p><b>Installers:</b> Installers are now available to install
	the latest versions of Mono with a single click from our <a

	page.  Thanks to Daniel from <a
