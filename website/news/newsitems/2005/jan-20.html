<h1>Mono Updates Bonanza</h1>

	<p><b>FireBird:</b> Carlos Guzm√°n's <a
	href="http://firebird.sourceforge.net/">Firebird database</a>
	provider has been checked into CVS and will be part of the
	next release of Mono 1.1.xx.

	<p>Firebird SQL can be used either in server/client mode, or
	it can be embedded into your application to simplify
	configuration and deployment of smaller applications.  Both
	modes are supported by Carlos' provider.

	<p><b>Windows.Forms:</b> Work continues on the new Mono
	Windows.Forms implementation.  A <a
	href="http://svn.myrealbox.com/blog/">blog</a> has been
	started specifically to track its progress.  Status of the
	development of various components is also <a
	href="http://svn.myrealbox.com/mwf/owners.html">available</a>.
	And finally over the winter break <a
	href="http://blog.sublimeintervention.com/index.php">Geoff
	Norton</a> added a native MacOS X driver.
