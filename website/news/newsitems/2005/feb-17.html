<h1>Mono 1.1.4 and 1.0.6 are released</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.1.4 and 1.0.6 have been released.

	<p>As of this version, Mono 1.1.4 has received more testing
	and more scrutiny that Mono 1.0.6, and we strongly recommend
	that people switch to the 1.1.4 release.

	<p>We will continue to support 1.0.x for those who can not do
	a larger change, but keep in mind that 1.1.4 at this point is
	stabler, has many less bugs, faster, better tested and more
	complete than the 1.0.6 series.

	<p>There are significant changes: make sure you read the
	release notes as there are many exiting features in monodoc,
	xsp, apache support, xml, relaxng, the C# compiler, the VM and
	more.
