	Novell/Imeem news brief</a> on Imeem's use of Mono:

	<blockquote>

	Imeem, a free desktop service that allows users to create
	personal private networks, has tapped Mono to quickly scale up
	its application from a simple technology demo running on .NET
	to an industrial strength server infrastructure to support its
	rapidly growing user base. The imeem development team also
	used Mono to develop client software that runs on both Windows
	and Mac OS X, two critical platforms in the consumer Internet
	market.
