	<p>We have also released an unstable version of gtk+ 2.8
	bindings for people who want to start experimenting with the
	cairo API.  This release is not for the faint of heart, and
	comes with no API stability guarantee for the new 2.8 API.
	This is a source only release and the tarball is available <a
	href="http://go-mono.com/sources/gtk-sharp-2.0/gtk-sharp-2.7.1.tar.gz">here</a>

	<p>Since 2.8 is a relatively small API change over 2.6, we
	hope to quickly move to stability.  If you find any issues,
	with the new API, please raise them promptly to ensure they
	are fixed.  As always, please <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Bugs">file a bug report</a>
	for any issues you encounter.
