	Mono Tools for Visual Studio have been released to a limited number of 
	developers for a closed preview cycle.</p>

	<p>This first release of the Mono tools integrates four major pieces of 
	new functionality into Visual Studio:</p>

	<ul>
    <li><b>Scan for Mono Compatibility (MoMA integration)</b> - The 
    integrated Mono Migration Analyzer (<a href="http://mono-project.com/MoMA" 
    target="_blank">MoMA</a>) can scan open projects for incompatibilities 
    and guide you to directly to them, making it easy to find and work through 
    issues as you develop. </li>

    <li><b>Run on Mono on Windows</b> - Testing against Mono on Windows can 
    help isolate issues arising from differences between Mono and .NET. </li>

    <li><b>Run on Mono on Linux</b> - Testing against Mono on Linux helps work 
    through issues that could be caused by differences in Windows and Linux. </li>

    <li><b>Debug on Mono on Linux</b> - Often, the best way to work through an 
    issue will be to debug the application on the target environment. Debug on 
    Mono on Linux brings this functionality to Visual Studio developers by 
    enabling remote debugging of Mono applications running on Linux. </li>
  </ul>
