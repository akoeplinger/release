	<p>Mono Tools for Visual Studio have been released to a limited 
	number of developers for a closed preview cycle. If you are 
	interested in joining the program during the next wave of 
	invitations, please visit the <a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/" 
	target="_blank">Mono Tools for Visual Studio website</a>, and 
	follow the .Sign Up!. link.&#160; This first release of the Mono 
	tools integrates four major pieces of new functionality into 
	Visual Studio:</p>

	There are some common stumbling blocks that keep .NET applications 
	from being able to run on Mono. These can be due to using parts of 
	the .NET framework that Mono does not implement or implements 
	differently, or reliance on native platform code like user32. 

	<p>The Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA) can scan your compiled assemblies 
	for these types of issues and point them out, making it easy to find 
	them and work around them. In </p>

	<h2 style="clear: both">Run on Mono on Windows</h2>

	When porting your application to run on Mono on Linux, there are 
	two types of issues that can occur: differences between Mono and 
	.NET and differences between Windows and Linux. 

	<p>One way to make this easier is to use two steps. During the 
	first step, use Mono on Windows to work out any issues arising 
	from differences between Mono and .NET. After your application 
	works on Mono, then focus on porting it to Mono on Linux. </p>

	While running an application on Mono on Windows will help work 
	through any issues arising from differences between Mono and .NET, 
	running the application on Mono on Linux will simplify the process 
	of working through issues that could be caused by differences in 
	Windows and Linux.</p>

	<h2 style="clear: both">Debug on Mono on Linux</h2>

	<p><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px"

	Often, the best way to work through an issue will be to debug 
	the application on the target environment. Debug on Mono on 
	Linux brings this functionality to Visual Studio developers 
	by enabling remote debugging of Mono applications running on Linux.</p>
