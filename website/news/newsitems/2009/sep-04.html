<h1>Mono for OSX has been updated</h1>

	<p>A refresh of the Mono 2.4.2.3 Framework Installer for Mac
	has been released. The only change in this release is a new
	version of GTK+ that resolves a number of known issues in
	MonoDevelop, including redraw bugs, control-click
	functionality, and Mac keybindings for standard GTK+
	widgets. The GTK+ build uses a branch of GTK+ 2.17.9
	maintained by Christian Hergert, sponsored by Unity.

	<p>You can find it on
	the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">downloads</a>
	section.
