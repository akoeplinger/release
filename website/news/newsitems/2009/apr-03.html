<h1>Telerik Announces Support for their ASP.NET controls on Mono!</h1>

	<p><a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik</a> is one of the
	most famous provider of controls for .NET.  We have been
	working for the past few months with Telerik to make sure that
	their <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx">RadControls
	for ASP.NET AJAX</a> product worked out of the box with Mono:

	<p>Today Telerik announced the availability of their product
	officially for Mono-based customers on Linux systems.  From
	their <a href="http://www.telerik.com/company/press-center/company-news/telerik-announces-support-for-mono.aspx">press
	release</a>:
	
	<blockquote>
	Telerik, the leading vendor of development tools and
	components for the Microsoft .NET platform announced that
	RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX fully supports the Mono runtime
	environment, an open source .NET framework sponsored by
	Novell, tailored for development of Linux applications.  The
	Telerik AJAX UI components is the first major commercial user
	interface (UI) suite to go cross-platform and allows
	developers to build rich .NET applications in a Linux
	environment.

	<p>“This has been a long-awaited feature, which we have been
	quietly working on for quite some time. Over the past few
	months, we have been actively testing the compatibility of our
	RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX offering with Mono", said Hristo
	Kosev, Telerik CTO. "We are extremely happy that our joint
	work with Novell will allow customers to build compelling
	high-performance ASP.NET AJAX-based applications and run them
	on Linux using Mono 2.4.”

	<p>The decision to work with Novell to extend the capabilities of
	RadControls over other platforms is in direct response to
	customer feedback and interest in Mono. Telerik and Novell are
	optimistic about the effect their partnership will have on the
	industry and the benefits it will bring to .NET developers.
	</blockquote>

	<p>Telerik is a major player in the control space in the .NET
	world and many developers turn to them for ready to use
	controls for their applications.   Developers that were
	previously using Telerik products can now host their products
	on Linux servers.   
	
	<p><b>Special thanks</b> go to Marek Habersack in the Mono
	team who worked tirelessly to fix Mono's ASP.NET stack.
	Working with the Telerik folks was a pleasure.  Telerik helped
	us by providing us access to their source code, their test
	suite and their QA team that made sure that their thousands of
	tests ran equally well on Mono as they did on Microsoft's
	.NET.
