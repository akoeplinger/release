	<a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/">Mono Tools for Visual Studio 1.0</a>
	has officially been released.

	<p>Support for developing and debugging Mono applications from within 
	Microsoft Visual Studio has been a feature requested from the .NET 
	developer community since very early in the project.s history.  While 
	our own <a href="http://monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a> continues to 
	grow in features in adoption, we also understand that developers 
	working in Visual Studio today are in no rush to leave behind their 
	current IDE and favorite Visual Studio add-ins.

	<p>Mono Tools integrates several key pieces of functionality directly 
	into Visual Studio.s menu system:

	<ul>
	  <li><b><a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/Moma.aspx">Analyze for Mono Migration</a></b> - Scan open projects for 
	  compatibility with Mono while developing, and navigate directly to 
	  issues from the Error List within Visual Studio</li>
	  <li><b><a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/TestWin.aspx">Run on Mono on Windows</a></b> - Test against Mono on Windows to 
	  isolate issues arising from differences between Mono and .NET.</li>
	  <li><b><a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/TestLin.aspx">Run on Mono on Linux</a></b> - Deploy and run your application on 
	  Mono on Linux with minimal effort.</li>
	  <li><b><a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/Debug.aspx">Debug on Mono on Linux</a></b> - Remotely debug your application 
	  running on the target platform</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In addition to these features that improve the day-to-day experience 
	of developing with Mono, this release incorporates a few additional 
	features to aid in deployment of .NET applications on Mono.

	<ul>
	  <li><b><a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/Package.aspx">Package for Linux</a></b> - Visually create a RPM installer 
	  packages for SUSE and openSUSE Linux for your .NET application</li>
	  <li><b><a href="http://go-mono.com/monovs/Studio.aspx">Create a SUSE Linux Appliance</a></b> - Use SUSE Studio to bundle your application into a 
	  Linux appliance for simplified distribution to your users.</li>
	</ul>
