<h1>Mono as an Enterprise Server Platform</h1>

        <p>With a focus on producing a <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Mar-30.html">
        faster, scalable and tuned version of Mono</a>, one of the
        primary goals of the Mono 2.4 release was to provide a
        solid basis for a supported and maintained platform for
        hosting ASP.NET and other .NET-based server applications
        on Linux.  The product based on that effort, the SUSE
        Linux Enterprise Mono Extension, is now available on the
        Novell website.  From Novell's <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/mono/">
        Mono product page</a>:

        <blockquote>
        The SUSE Linux Enterprise Mono Extension provides support
        for running .NET applications on SUSE Linux, including
        hosting ASP.NET 2.0, ASP.NET AJAX and ASP.NET MVC
        applications on the Apache web server.  With this offering,
        corporate and ISV developers who run .NET on Linux receive
        support for x86, x86_64 and mainframe-based server
        consolidation. This results in increased flexibility for
        organizations who want to utilize their physical resources
        on the most commonly-used hardware platforms to leverage
        their existing .NET capabilities.
        </blockquote>

        <p>If you, like many, have wondered where you can find
        support and increased flexibility for running your .NET
        applications on Linux, you now have an answer.
