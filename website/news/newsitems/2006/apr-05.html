<h1>Tracking Performance in Mono</h1>

	<p>Tomas Calibera at Charles University in Prague has updated
	his Mono performance tracking to include a new set of tests.
	All of the runtime tests in mono/tests are now ran on a daily
	basis and compared against the last day build to identify
	early performance problems. 

	<p>Visit the new tests <a

	<p>Tomas' team has been tracking Mono's performance since 2004.
