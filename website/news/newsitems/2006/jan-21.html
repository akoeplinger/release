	<blockquote>
	
	For the first time, the O'Reilly Open Source Convention will
	feature a Microsoft Windows track. The focus of this track
	will hopefully capture the growing momentum behind projects
	like Mono, mojoPortal, iFolder, TomBoy, F-Spot, Banshee,
	NHibernate, NAnt, and Nunit (just to name a few).
