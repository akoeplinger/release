<h1>Updated Mono VMware Image</h1>

	<p>We have updated the <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/VMWare_Image">Mono VMware
	image</a>.    It is available from our <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">downloads</a>
	page.

	<p>New in this release:

	<ul>

	<li>All packages from a default OpenSUSE install are included.
	This results in a bigger image download but should be more
	convenient.
	
	<li>Postgres has been installed
	
	<li>Bigger default font size
	
	<li>A share was up in /srv/www/htdocs so that Windows
	developers can easily access it.
	
	<li>Mono can now be updated without updating the VMware
	machine, so you will be able to pick up new versions without
	downloading this image again. 
	
	<li>We included phpMyAdmin, a MySQL administration front-end,
	you can access it <a
	href="http://localhost/phpMyAdmin">here</a>. 
	
	<li>.exe files associated with mono in the nautilus file
	manager to allow launching them via double click
	
	<li>The README in the image (http://localhost) now includes all
	accounts for local users, MySQL accounts.

	</ul>
