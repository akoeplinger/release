<h1>Mono 1.1.13.6 released</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.1.13.6 has been <a
	href="http://go-mono.com/archive/1.1.13.5/">released</a>.

	<p>Ever since the release of Mono 1.1.13 on January 11th we
	have been quietly updating the packages on the site with small
	bug fix releases of Mono 1.1.13 without making an
	announcement.

	<p>This is just a late announcement for those missing
	releases.
