<h1>Mono 1.1.16: Inlining, Windows.Forms and More!!</h1>

	<p>This is the longest gap we have had between Mono releases
	(1.1.15 to 1.1.16), but the wait was worth it.   The inlining
	optimization is now turned on as well as a number of other
	small optimizations that enhance inlining and the results are
	excellent.  Thanks go to Massi that tuned the optimizations
	and hunt down every bug until it was ready.

	<p>There is a lot of new stuff, in particular, Windows.Forms
	is better than ever in every possible way.
