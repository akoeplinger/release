<h1>Mainsoft Releases Grasshopper 2.0 Preview</h1>

	<p>Mainsoft, a long time contributor to the Mono project,
	today announced the release of the Grasshopper 2.0 technology
	preview, which introduces support for Microsoft's Visual
	Studio 2005 IDE and the .NET Framework 2.0. The preview will
	enable C# developers to use the Visual Studio 2005 IDE, the
	new C# 2.0 features, and the new ASP.NET 2.0 controls to
	quickly develop Web applications that run on Tomcat and can be
	deployed on Linux and other Java-enabled platforms.

	<p>Grasshopper now uses Cecil for doing the CLI to JVM
	translation as well.  Developers can also use the Grasshopper
	2.0 Technology Preview to port the Microsoft Personal Web Site
	Starter Kit to run on Tomcat.
