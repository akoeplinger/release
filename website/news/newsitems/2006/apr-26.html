<h1>Numerical Libraries for Mono and .NET</h1>

	<p><a href="http://www.dnanalytics.net/">dnAnalytics</a> is is
	a numerical library for the .NET Framework. The library is
	written in C# and is available as a fully managed library, but
	also provides an interface to native BLAS and LAPACK
	libraries. The native interface is compatible with ATLAS/
	CLAPACK, Intel's MKL, and AMD's ACML. The library is
	compatible with Mono and has been tested on Windows, and
	various Linux distributions. The current release includes
	matrix, vector and complex number classes, and support for
	basic linear algebra routines (such as LU, Cholesky, QR,
	Levinson, and SVD). We will be adding optimization, calculus,
	random number, statistical, option pricing, genetic
	programming, and neural network components in the future.

	<p>Their Native Libaray Interace (NLI) provides a managed
	interface to native numerical libraries. Currently, it wraps
	all of the BLAS routines and the most commonly used LAPACK
	routines from ATLAS, CLAPACK, Intel's Math Kernal Library,
	AMD's ACML. More LAPACK routines and additionaly libraries
	will be wrapped in the future.
