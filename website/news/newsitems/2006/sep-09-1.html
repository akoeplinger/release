<h1>Mono Summit</h1>

	<p>We finally have a location for the upcoming Mono Summit in
	Boston:  The event will be held
	at <a
	href="http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/BOSLW">Marriot
	Long Wharf Hotel</a> in Boston, MA on October 23 and
	24th. 

	<p>This is located close to the Aquarium T stop in Boston. 

	<p>If you are coming,
	please <a

	in advance and if you wish to connect with other Mono summit
	attendees, you can list yourself in
	our <a

	public Wiki</a>.

	<p>My boss today suggested that we should have some kind of
	reception, am thinking we could have a "Welcome Meeting" on
	Sunday evening for those arriving to the city, and maybe some
	small soire on Monday and maybe some parting drinks for
	Tuesday.   Anyways, if you got some awesome idea about what to
	do with 80-100 C# developers, drop me a line.
