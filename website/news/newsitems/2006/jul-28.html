<h1>Mono VMware Image</h1>

	<p>We have created a Mono VMware image that people can use
	with the free <a
	href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMware
	player</a>.

	<p>The image is a SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10, and it
	includes the latest version of Mono, the development tools,
	documentation and samples for Windows.Forms and ASP.NET.

	<p>The MonoDevelop IDE is included in the image for
	developers, and Postgress and MySQL are installed to test your
	application with a database.

	<p>The image is available from our <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">downloads</a>
	page.
