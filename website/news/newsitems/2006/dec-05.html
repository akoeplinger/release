<h1>Mono 1.2.2 and Mono Migration Assistant 1.1</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.2.2 is out.  See the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.2">release
	notes</a>.   This release fixes various important bug fixes as
	well as implementing many of the APIs that we identified using
	Moma as being important to our user community.

	<p>All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

	<p>In addition to the Mono release, the <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moma">Mono Migration
	Assistant</a> has been released.

	<p>This new release of Moma has been updated to the latest
	API and it contains new features that would allow developers
	to optionally submit feedback to us and also has a mechanism
	to update the API definitions from future Mono releases.

	<p>If you tried your software with Moma 1.0.1, please try Moma
	1.1 again.
