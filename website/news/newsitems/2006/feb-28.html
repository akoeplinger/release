<h1>OSX/x86 test image available</h1>

	<p>Mono has been ported to MacOS X/x86, we are making some
	test images available to identify some issues before our
	upcoming release.

	<p>The image is available in here: <a
	href="ftp://www.go-mono.com/archive/test/MonoFramework-1.1.13-02.28.2006.dmg">MonoFramework-1.1.13-02.28.2006.dmg</a>.

	<p>Thanks go to Geoff Norton and Paolo Molaro for getting the
	port done and to Imeem which provided Geoff with remote access
	to the hardware.
