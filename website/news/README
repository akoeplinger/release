This module is the Mono web site.

Today Mono is being deployed with a Novell service called Teamsite,
and we did not have much control over the editing process or who could
make changes.  

With this module, am effectively moving the control back into SVN, so
people can make changes to the website, and the web site contents will
be then synchronized from here (it still requires someone from Novell to
actually push the web content up).

* Novell updaters:

	Make sure that you do:

		make get
		make diff

	To ensure that we do not loose changes that might have been done
	by the teamsite group.  If there are missing changes, please apply
	the changes to the `edit' tree.

	Once the changes have been done, use:

		make push

	To upload the changes to the server.

Miguel.
