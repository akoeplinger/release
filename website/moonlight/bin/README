moonlight.dll is commited to svn on purpose

go-mono.com is running xsp1, and does not recompile assemblies when the code changes.

Code in .aspx file gets regenerated.

When updating any .cs files in the project, the .dll has to be built locally, and moved 
from bin/Debug/moonlight.dll to bin/moonlight.dll and commited to svn.

Then on go-mono, do 'svn up' to pull down the new assembly
