<h1>MonoTouch and iPhone OS 4 Update</h1>

  <h2>MonoTouch 3.0.0</h2>
	<p>On Friday, we released 
	<a href="http://monotouch.net/Releases/MonoTouch_3.0.0">MonoTouch 3.0.0</a>, 
	which includes our support for the new APIs in iPhoneOS 4.
	We are excited about this release, and look forward to hearing 
	feedback from MonoTouch developers as they explore all the new 
	features that Apple unveiled at last week's iPhoneOS 4 
	announcement.  This release is only available to developers that 
	have access to Apple's iPhoneOS 4, as the API is currently 
	confidential.

	<p>The support for iPhone OS 4 that we are now shipping is a 
	testament of our approach to support native iPhone application 
	development: Offering developers their preferred language to 
	leverage the exact same APIs that Objective-C developers would 
	use.

  <h2>iPhone Developer Agreement</h2>
	<p>While, we have heard little direct feedback from Apple 
	regarding recently reported changes to the iPhone Developer 
	Program Agreement, we have heard consistent feedback that Apple 
	is concerned about inefficient apps created using abstraction 
	layers that hide native APIs. 

	<p>We believe that several bloggers and journalists have misjudged MonoTouch by 
	characterizing it as an abstraction with disregard for its actual
	features. As MonoTouch does not hide native APIs and is not an 
	abstraction layer, we continue to believe that MonoTouch conforms 
	to the spirit and intent of the terms spelled out in the developer 
	agreement.

	<p>MonoTouch brings the best of multiple worlds: The C# language 
	and the iPhone OS frameworks.  And it does this without abstraction 
	layers, inefficient libraries, glue or exposing a different set of 
	APIs than those of the native iPhone OS.  When developers create 
	iPhone and iPad applications using MonoTouch, they use the C# 
	language to take advantage of the features found in .NET like 
	garbage collection, full type safety, and Language Integrated 
	Query while interfacing directly with iPhone OS libraries, 
	including UIKIt, CoreGraphics, CoreAnimation, GameKit, 
	AudioToolbox, AVFoundation and 
	<a href="http://monotouch.net/Features">many more</a>. 

	<p>We have also heard many positive updates from middleware 
	vendors within the iPhone ecosystem.  Some have already reported 
	direct approval of their platforms, and Unity (a Mono licensee on 
	iPhone) have reported that they will be meeting with Apple this 
	week to discuss the matter. 

  <h2>New Apps Since iPhone OS 4 Announcement</h2>
	<p>We are also pleased to announce that since the iPhone OS 4 
	announcement, several MonoTouch users have received App Store 
	approval for listing their iPhone and iPad applications, including 
	<a href="http://www.touchplaybook.com/">Touch Playbook</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.rlysimple.com/">Really Simple</a>,  and 
	<a href="http://lcarsreader.com/">LCARS Reader</a>.

	<p>Readers interested in seeing a more general listing of 
	MonoTouch applications in Apple's App Store can look to the 
	<a href="http://monotouch.info/MonoTouch/Apps">Apps page at MonoTouch.info</a>.
  
  <h2>Enterprise MonoTouch</h2>
	<p>It is important to point out that the new iPhone Developer 
	Agreement terms are for AppStore deployment and not the Enterprise 
	program that allows deployment of in-house application to users in 
	the enterprise (using the Enterprise Deployment program).
