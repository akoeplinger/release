<h1>MonoTouch on iPad</h1>

	<p>The MonoTouch team is very excited about today's iPad announcement. 
  MonoTouch users should expect that MonoTouch apps will run on the iPad 
  in the same way that apps developed with the current iPhone SDK will work 
  on the iPad.  

  <p>We will begin releasing updated versions of MonoTouch with additional
  support for iPad features as soon as Apple makes the new SDK available.
