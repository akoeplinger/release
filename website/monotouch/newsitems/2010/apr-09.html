<h1>MonoTouch and iPhone OS 4</h1>

	<p>This is an update from the MonoTouch team at Novell to the
	MonoTouch community.
	
	<p>Many have contacted us about reports on the changes in the
	iPhone Developer Program Agreement and while we can not
	comment on the specifics of a confidential agreement, we want
	to address some of the points that are being brought up.
	
	<p>We believe that MonoTouch brings an impressive value to the
	Apple ecosystem.
	
	<p>MonoTouch's C-powered runtime blends the power of native
	code and Apple's iPhoneOS APIs with type safety, automatic
	memory management, and other benefits that years of runtime
	innovation have delivered to the ISO Common Language
	Infrastructure.
	
	<p>We are reaching out to Apple for clarification on their
	intention, and believe there is plenty of room for
	course-correction prior to the final release of the 4.0 SDK.
	
	<p>MonoTouch's programming model exposes the iPhoneOS API to the
	C# language to give developers the same control and access
	that Objective-C developers get.
	
	<p>If Apple's motives are technical, or are intended to ensure
	the use of the Apple toolchain, MonoTouch should have little
	difficulty staying compliant with the terms of the SDK.
	MonoTouch runs only on Mac OS X, and integrates tightly with
	XCode and the iPhone SDK.  Applications built with MonoTouch
	are native applications indistinguishable from other native
	applications, only expose Apple's documented APIs and uses a
	rigorous test suite to ensure that we conform to the iPhoneOS
	ABIs and APIs.
	
	<p>With this in mind, the MonoTouch team remains excited about
	the potential for Enterprise and AppStore-deployable
	applications developed for the iPhone and iPad.  Support for
	iPhoneOS 4.0 on MonoTouch will be arriving soon.
