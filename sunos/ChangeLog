2006-01-26  Wade Berrier <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Fixed environment scripts (accidentally published a package without the reloc vars...)

2006-01-20  Wade Berrier <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Initial package
	* Unify some installer and packaging code for solaris packaging
	* Use packages from sunfreeware.com
	* Add some environment settings to setup.sh for relocation
	* Picked sunfreeware over blastwave... little bit out of date, 
	  but fresh installs of solaris 8 will need some sun patches 
	  before software from blastwave will work.
	* Sun binutils don't work on Mono
	* binutils strip doesn't work on sunos8 (maybe fixed in later version than
	  what's on sunfreeware)
	* Latest glib on sunfreeware is broken (Use glib-2.2.3)
	* Lots of software in the package requires patch 112438 (solaris 8 sparc)
	  for /dev/u?random
