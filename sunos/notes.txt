Basic ideas behind building and packaging on SunOS:


Build from source the latest stuff I can find.

Save these as zip files, much like the win32 is done.
Probably need to do these for all the mono/gtk-sharp deps.

I'll bundle the libgcc from sunfreeware because I don't want to build gcc.
 (I could even be able to extract/handle local.gz files)

I would bundle more of sunfreeware, except their packages are out of date.

So, after all the zip files are collected,

lay them out, and dump them into a big sol pkg.  It's going to be quite large.

install to /opt/mono
