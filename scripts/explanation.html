need:

<ul>
    <li>Mono: These are ready-to-compile source code packages for the
    runtime and the libraries (includes binaries for all the C# components).
    These only require a C compiler installation to use. Latest is

   <li>MonoCharge: contains precompiled libraries and executables for

    <li>MonoLite: this package contains the bare basics to get your
    Mono installation   corlib, System, System.Xml and the C#
    compiler.  Like a MonoCharge, but it contains only the bare basics to
