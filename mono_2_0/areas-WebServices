Web Services assembly.

Web Services
------------

* Added support for Soap 1.2.

* New way of doing async calls in client proxies, based on events
instead of the BeginInvoke/EndInvoke pattern.

* Basic Profile conformance checker. The Soap Basic Profile is a subset
of Soap, which simplifies the protocol and makes interoperability
easier. There is a new class that can check if a WSDL conforms the Basic
Profile.

* The WSDL tool has new code generation options, and allows the sharing
of data types between several web services.
