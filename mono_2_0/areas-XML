XML 2.0 study
by Atsushi Enomoto (atsushi@ximian.com)

Here I summarize XML 2.0 stuff.

** New feature survey

        * XmlReaderSettins/XmlWriterSettings support
          They now supports some options such as schema specification,
          DTD rejection, schema conformance level, tokenization changes.

        * W3C compliant Schema support
          such as XmlSchemaSet, ConformanceLevel, XmlSchemaValidity.
          They means now MS schema validator is almost the same as
          what W3C expects

        * Editable XPathNavigator support
          Current XPathDocument is (by design) read-only and we might
          have to implement another (simplified) DOM.

        * XQuery support
          It is totally new in 2.0. Almost all things are internal or
          MS.Internal.* namespaces: XQuery parser, AST, XPath 2.0
          iterator, XQuery runtime, "Rqil" generation (it looks like
          expression -> IL)

        * XmlSerializer additions
          many small changes such as importer extension (fully
          CodeDom oriented design required?) and import context etc.

        * XsdInference
          Infers XML schema from document (different from DataSet one)

** Required Improvements (1.0 legacy stuff)

        * NameTable optimization
        * more W3C-spec conformant DTD parser (entity parse)
        * XmlTextReader optimization
        * XmlSchema optimization
        * DTD validation optimization

** Mono 1.2 TODO and non-TODO

        o major part of XmlReaderSettings may be done in a week or two
          (our XmlValidatingReader is already pluggable)
        x We can leave other part of those classes as post-1.2 matters.

        o minimum XmlSchema improvements
          XmlSchemaSet support, hopefully in a week or two.
          Implement some new schema feature for XQuery stuff.
        x Rest of the fixes are trivial or ignorable (post-1.2 matters).
        x Once XmlSchemaSet support is done, XsdInference is totally
          detached and optional; we can ask others to challenge.

        o editable XPathNavigator
          First, modify XmlDocumentNavigator to be editable
          Hopefully done in a week or two.
        x editable XPathDocument is later optional work (can be done
          after 1.2) XPathChangeNavigator is now obsolete and might
          disappear in the RTM.

        o XQuery/XPath2.0 parser and AST (abstract syntax tree)
          jay-based parser is halfly written (far from complete).
        o XPath 2.0 (and XQuery) iterator & expression evaluator
        o XQuery function library based on XPath 2.0 iterator & AST
        x Compilation into XQuery IL (Qil) is not mandatory right now.

        x new addition to XmlSerializer looks aggregation of small
          changes and my feeling is that it can be done as post-1.2
          matter. But not sure.

** Some notes

The tasks are mostly XQuery stuff. Some of other works would be
difficult for other hackers (such as XmlSchema improvements), while
some tasks can be done by anyone (such as new editable XPathDocument
and XsdInference).

XQuery tasks looks so big. Some tasks can be done separately (such
as XQuery datatype conversion aka XQueryConvert), but as a whole
it will be like XPath/XSLT development.

As long as Gonzalo's API corcomparison, ASP.NET is at least 5x
harder than XML 2.0.

I also remember that Mainsoft guys said that they would like to
"take an active role in System.Xml". Whatever I was asked was about
optimization matters, but they might be going to do more.
