<h2>Mono ASP.NET Sampler</h2>

	<p>This is a sampler of a few ASP.NET applications that have
	been installed in this virtual machine.  These applications have
	been modified to run in Linux.   See the section on <a
	href="#porting">"Source Code"</a> for details about the changes made
	to the software to run on Linux.

	<p>To learn more about Mono, visit <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/">www.mono-project.com</a>.
	
	<p>Today Mono has complete support for ASP.NET 1.0 and 1.1,
	and only partial support for ASP.NET 2.0.  Support for ASP.NET
	2.0 is being worked on, and will be ready in early 2007. 
	
	<ul>

		application.

		<li><a
		href="http://localhost/DasBlog/newtelligence.DasBlog.Web">DasBlog</a>:
		A port of DasBlog blogging software.

		<li><a
		href="http://localhost/NGallery/">NGallery</a>
		photo management application.
		<br>
		To admin the application, go <a
		href="http://localhost/NGallery/admin">here</a> and login as
		"admin", password "changeme".

<h2>Source Code</h2>

	<p>The source code for all the applications demostrated here
	are located on the <a
	href="file:///home/mono/public_html">public_html</a> directory
	of the user's home directory.

	<p>A link has been placed on the desktop to help you locate
	it, you can use this source code as a reference to find out
	what kind of changes we have done to make ASP.NET applications
	work on Linux.
	
<h3>Trying out your own code</h3>

	<p>Mono currently does not have an ASP.NET designer that will
	run on Linux, but you can use the code that you produce with
	Visual Studio 2003.

	<p>You can try your own applications by creating a directory
	with your code in the <a
	href="file:///home/mono/public_html">public_html</a>
	directory.  You can do this by connecting with the file
	manager to your machine hosting the software and copying the
	directory containing your application here, and then visiting
	the following url:

	<p><center>
	 <b>http://localhost/directoryname/page.aspx</b>
	</center>

	<p>Where <i>directoryname</i> is the directory where you deployed
	your application, and <i>page.aspx</i> is the initial page for your
	software, typically Default.aspx.

<h3>Porting your ASP.NET application to Linux</h3>

	<p>Porting ASP.NET applications from Windows to Linux is
	relatively easy.  These are some useful hints that you can use
	when developing cross platform applications:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Linux file system is case sensitive:</b>
		On Linux the files "readme" and "README" are two
		different files, that is, Linux has a case-sensitive
		file system.
		<br>
		This is an important distinction for many applications
		because you might have created a "Login.aspx" page,
		but you reference the page as "login.aspx" or
		"LOGIN.ASPX" from your source code.   You must make
		sure that all references use the same file name
		casing.

		<li><b>Path Separator is different:</b>  On Windows,
		the path separator is "\" while on Linux it is "/", it
		is possible to create files that contain a "\" in
		their names on Linux.
		<br>
		To write portable software, you must make sure that
		you use the System.IO.Path.PathSeparator character
		when you must concatenate paths, or even better, use
		the <tt>System.IO.Path.Combine</tt> method to combine
		pathnames.

		<li><b>Mono lacks EnterpriseServices:</b> If your
		application requires EnterpriseServices, your software
		will not likely run on Mono as we have not implemented
		it.

		<li><b>Mono lacks cross-process transactions:</b> Mono
		currently supports only local-process transactions.
	</ul>

	href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mailing_Lists">the list of
	available lists</a>.

<h3>Databases</h3>

	<p>You can continue using your SQL Server database with Mono,
	you do not have to migrate this.  But if you want to replace
	SQL server with another database, Mono provides an extensive
	set of database connetors for MySQL, Postgress, Sybase,
	Oracle, IBM's DB2 and also the embedded SQLite database.
